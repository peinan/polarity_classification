B000G1IL3Q:bad_choice:r._a._gamero	1.0	this device didnt work properly at all, i lost my money on this purchase.sorry, but that's how i feel
B000G1IL3Q:broke_before_i_could_use_it:justin_w._jett_"jwjett"	1.0	Plugged it into my wife's car. Set it, listened to 1/2 of a song, then went to remove it to try it in my car. The plug part broke apart in cigarette lighter, leaving part of the plug in the jack. Returned it, Satechi sent my refund quickly
B000JZDXXM:great:stephanie_hunt	1.0	I love the color and the flexibility of the material. It doesn't slip out of your hand and the cover gives full protection
B000A5LX0G:disappointed:sok	2.0	I expected this bag to be much more comfortable ... but I have to constantly pull it back up on my shoulder just as often as other handbags. However, I do like all the compartments for organizing
B0002VG57O:somehow_not_as_good_as_birks:l._supheert	2.0	They run MUCH smaller than Birkenstocks. I sent the size 44 back (which is comfy in the comparable model in Birkenstocks; is it the Boston?) and got the 45 and it STILL feels small. The upper is ok, the shoe isn't the best made thing but is adequate; it's just the size thing that bothered me
B0002VG57O:disappointed:b._martin	1.0	Does not say on amazons site that these are shipped in narrow widths only.  Supplier does not carry the wide ones.  Birkenstocks are normally wide unless you specify narrow widths.  Not here.  No exchange possible.  Now I'm stuck with shoes that don't fit and midwest sports couldn't care less. I won't ever order from them again
B00009MFB9:not_sure_how_it_rates:erika_m._hawk	1.0	never got to see it because shipping company carelessly left it on my porch and someone stole it along with other items. contacted seller and u.p.s. both told me basically I was out $45.00. tryed to report it to amazon but they intentionally have no contact info. on their web site. live and learn won't shop amazon again! thanks 4 nothing amazo
B000ICUZ28:not_durable,_and_you_can_buy_it_in_many_places:liping_wang_"commute_reader"	2.0	Well, it is a cool product, and good idea to use. But the bulb was broken in first 3 days. We put the second one on. Dont know how long this second one will last. We used it only few minutes in the morning, when we need to get some cloth out of closet.

Also, it is not on line product only. I found Bed Bath Beyond has it and CVS has it. They sell 9.99. Without extra bulb. But still, misleading to say online only.
B000ICUZ28:don't_waste_one_dollar_on_this_piece_of_junk:j._brandt	1.0	Maybe, just maybe, someone will buy one of these Stick Up Bulbs and maybe, just maybe, the bulb will last more than about 10 minutes of total use before it burns out. I thought to myself "buy another one because maybe this one was defective." I bought three more.....every time the tiny bulb burned out in minutes of use. It's a great idea....but a worthless piece of junk. The spare bulb? Useless as well. 

Don't waste a dollar on this junk. If I could have found the receipts I would have gotten my money back.
B000ICUZ28:does_not_last:pearlythebunny_"some_mama"	1.0	This light worked for one day. I should have known better because in the past, I bought a tap light, and it worked for only a few days, too. Don't waste your money
B0006PWENK:pfff:j._wataha	1.0	I have a small head and it makes it look huge!

Maybe if i had a big head it would look alright  pfff
B000E5RK0Y:holes_after_only_two_months_:j._beitel	1.0	I got both my sons these socks and really liked the performance, thickness, etc. However, it has been only two months and several of my three year olds' socks now have holes in the toes, the heels, and you can see the fabric wearing thin and about to have holes at other places. My 8 month olds' socks are fine, however, he doesn't give them the wear of a three year old. So if you have a baby, these socks are great! If you have a preschooler, very poor choice
B000FTMT8W:nice_logo,_poor_material.:kasper05_"kasper05"	2.0	Turn around time to receive item was good.  Material of the shirt was sub-par (very thin) for the price.
B000H82FT4:very_disappointing:a._franklin_"cheekfreak"	1.0	These jeans were so very disappointing.  After hearing about PDC many times, I was excited to own a pair.  But these jeans were made of cheap, uncomfortable fabric and the style just doesn't work.  I won't be buying PDC again
B0007IBNRE:runs_very_small:bull_dog_builders_llc	1.0	My son runs true to size on most clothing including Childrens Place but the PJs run very small and when I held them up to each other the different patterns were sized different.  At 5 months he is still wearing 3-6 mo in most PJs but already grown our of Childrens Place 6-9 mo PJs.  I bought several pairs and some of them he never could wear.  Buy a different brand unless you can go to the store and actually try them on
B000FH97WU:these_boots_are_not_meant_for_walking:cori_d	2.0	In theory this boot seemed perfect: added some height , came in  perfectly wearable colors, was made of real leather, the price was unbeatable , BUT ( yes, unfortunately a big but)like everything else which seems perfect , it was perfectly flawed . I did my research,read the reviews and ordered a boot half size bigger than my usual . But still was super tight across the ankle and top of my feet , totally crushing my veins. I'm a big "shoe collector" and I can recognize a design error when I see one. Surprisingly that it came from this brand , usually so quality-reliable . These boots are not meant for walking . If you want to take a pretty picture in them , they might fulfill THAT purpose
B0007XVO0U:foxfire_22_pocket_vest:fred_glow	1.0	Good features include many pockets.

Bad feature is the poor quality of the vest lining. As a result, the two pockets where I carried car keys developed holes after a couple of weeks.

Avoid this product if you intend to carry keys in the pockets.
B000JM90M8:not_satisfied:j._palmer	1.0	I thought this case would be like the ipod cases I have seen that look like they are actually part of the ipod; it is not.  The case does not fit properly on the ipod and slips off the top leaving room for damage.  The belt clip is difficult to get on and off and the stand doesn't work well.  Overall I would not recomend this product
B000JM90M8:no:w._wynn_"wbwynn12"	1.0	Poor fit for 80gb...stick on film to protect video face is a joke...it's cheap but save your money on this and buy something better
B0009PUJSO:okay_for_the_price:pamela_j._karr	2.0	It is a comfortable little t-shirt dress for 9 bucks.  Be careful because the sizes run small.  If you get it, buy a size larger than you normally would
B0009PUJSO:you're_kidding_me:that_guy_"yeah.__him"	1.0	I bought this as a surprise for my wife.  When we opened it, I thought that 1) we were shipped a pillowcase by mistake or 2) they hadn't finished it.  Edges are raw and unfinished.  It is a complete waste of money because returning it will mean that the shipping both directions will cost me more than the dress cost.  I understand that "you get what you pay for," but this was a piece of garbage.

This dress in the picture is OBVIOUSLY pinned and pulled back to give it any shape whatsoever.  The picture does NOT accurately represent this item at all.  This will fit like a potato sack, folks.  I notice that the "raw edges" are now listed as a "feature."  Ahem.

In a recent e-mail exchange with them, I was told that (their words now): "quality is a subjective issue."  They have pestered me to change my feedback and I have challenged them three times now to point out any inaccuracies in my feedback, and I would absolutely recant them.

In their defense: my money has now been refunded.

Now... anybody want to buy a pillowcase with three holes in it, worn for 90 seconds?  It would have been off sooner, but my wife was laughing too hard to get it back over her head.

Wish I could rate as a "zero
B0007TC07A:barely_serviceable:billisutra_-_the_way_of_the_cat	2.0	Save yourself the trouble and get the BRAIDED (3-line) latex hose type of clothesline. Want suction cups / rings / snap hooks, etc? Buy them for pennies at a drug store. The problem with this clothesline is that you can't make your clothes stay in position with only 2 lines--they slide down to the lowest point in the middle. The only way you can keep clothes somewhat separate so that they'll dry is with a braided line, period.
B000GD5B82:bad_sole:robert_simbe	1.0	The sole of the my shoe started to wear out only after three days of use.  I won't recommend it to anyone
B000GD5B82:ok.,_really_tight_at_the_front:mwenmad_"jjlox75"	2.0	for $30, i guess i cant complain but this are not good looking or comfortable shoe
B000NVRS42:not_worth_your_time_and_money._:sharken4cer	1.0	I was going to surprise my girlfriend with a nice "just because" gift. When I opened the package I was really disappointed. The color of the item was more brown than eggplant and the quality of the fabric was like stitching shop rags together. 
Now I have to return the item because it just looks bad. The problem with returning is the non-refundable $7.50 to ship to me and the $5.95 I have to pay to ship it back to them. 

I also have to take away a star for receiving the item late and having to hassle with their customer service department who couldn't find my order.
B000FA0TE2:no_good_shoes:b._luu	1.0	bad shoe for sure. it is not for running. but want a cheap shoe for some dirty yard work. this may d
B000IVOL2Y:fake?:suzy	1.0	Shouldn't Amazon address this in some way? If it is real I would buy it; if it is fake (and the previous poster certainly seems right on that score) shouldn't this be off Amazon's site? I think it becomes an issue of Amazon's credibility..
B000IVOL2Y:this_vendor_is_not_an_authorized_distributor_of_this_bag:odis_nollan	1.0	I purchased a bag from this vendor, thinking that by being affiliated with Amazon that they were legit.
I got the bag and thought it looked fake.  The vendor told me to take it to the nearest boutique.
The boutique confirmed that it was NOT authentic, so I am returning the bag I got from Moda Party and feel cheated by the high price paid for a phoney, unauthentic bag
B000EQ6BC6:not_as_comfortable:c._satterlee_"craftyfox"	2.0	This shoe isn't as comfortable as my other Keds shoes.  It also doesn't breath as well.  If you have a tendency to develope hot feet, this wouldn't be a good purchase for you.  It also needs the new insoles that the newer Keds shoes have
B000BD35PI:they_must_think_we_are_stupid...:r._utu	1.0	So I ordered this shirt and I got an entirely diffent one, the packing slip had the right order #. The shirt I received was long sleeved, crew neck with a notch in it. Ans when I called them,the person I spoke to was not the least bit shocked/ amazed or even willing to send the right one, she just said send it back... think twice unless you don't mind making trips to the post offic
B0002OQGA2:lovely,_but_poor_color_quality:l._m.	2.0	These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!
B0002OQGA2:i_wont_do_it_again:james_d._vantassel	1.0	I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i
B00007GDES:passable_second_wallet:shanaz_sukhdeo_"'why_buy'_guy"	2.0	This wallet is fifty-fifty. The inside is great and holds cards as a wallet should. The outside, well... ...the UNCOVERED metal clip does not press against the leather so you need about 10 folded bills to get the right thickness to close the gap between the inside of the clip and the leather - less than 10 bills and expect the bills to separate from the wallet - in your pocket (ok) but not good in the open. Maximum number of bills - about 20 folded. Occasionally press down the metal closer to the leather as it gets farther apart as it is used. The metal clip on the outside is not good to your trousers. If the clip is facing out - before too long the trouser will have a horrible looking mark from rubbing that part of your thigh against your hand or even worse, other objects. So I started facing the clip in, resting against my thigh - not very comfortable but not too harsh to leave a mark on your thigh. But `facing in' is very awkward when seated, like driving. Definitely not designed for back pockets. Why Buy: As a second wallet (one should have at least two wallets - to separate credit cards, IDs so all is not lost if one wallet is lost/stolen. Put the small bills and one or two ONLY small limits credit cards in your back pocket wallet - pull the back pocket one out for the bandits and run away with this other wallet on you). As a gift for any guy - romantic or non-romantic
B0000A0MT0:way_too_small:neill_dumont	1.0	A year or so ago, I bought several of these on sale.  They are poorly sized (I have 4XT), far too tight for a big man like me to wear comfortably.  Maybe you could order several sizes too big to get a good fit, but unless you want everyone to see every roll of fat, I'd avoid buying these
B0007MCQ8K:bostonian_men's_tahoe_oxford,_black,_14_w:carsten_seebers	2.0	The shoes are true to size and very comfortable. But only 3 months after purchase the sole and the upper leather are starting to seperate. 
Really expected a better quality.
B000072YPQ:thought_it_was_bigger_:a._bailey	2.0	Just too small for wat i needed it for had to went and get something else bigger to use.
B000CQ492W:slippers_fell_apart!:snowball	1.0	I gave these slippers to my mother for Christmas and they do not hold up well.  The first pair came apart in the wash and the second pair hasn't been washed yet, but they're already coming apart also.  Not a good buy.
B000CQ492W:do_not_recommend!:j._martin	1.0	They totally fell apart after wearing them 2 or 3 times!  I expected more having paid nearly $20 for a pair of slippers.  VERY dissapointed
B000CQ492W:the_worst_slipper_i_have_ever_bought:q._chen	1.0	after only one week use at home, the sole was completely broken. the worst quality slipper i have ever seen
B000F0K8F2:i_did_not_purchase_this_shoe:beverly_kai_"beach_bunny"	1.0	I didn't purchase this shoe. I ordered two pairs of another Dr. Scholl's that day.You must have an error in the records
B000HTW9TY:polyester,_not_cotton:k._rice_"luciana"	1.0	This item is not 100% cotton.  Rather, it is 100% polyester
B0002PCD3K:misled_on_search_results:k._m._williams	1.0	We were disappointed when we received this because it showed up in a search with silk robes and pajamas and I guess I assumed tht it was silk.  Rather stiff and uncomfortable
B0002PCD3K:wouldn't_buy_again:dellis	1.0	Very nice feeling robe and fit well.  Although I only had it 3 weeks and one washing and the seams on the lapel started coming undone.

My wife is now making me one instead
B0002PCD3K:plastic:j._m._valera_"me3d"	1.0	I purchased this expecting a high quality Satin robe, but what I received was a run of the mil polyester robe. Yes, it is shiny, but it feel like plastic.

Sadly, this will be returned
B000ANSUH2:stuart_little_he_ain't:tom_danger	2.0	We have a big smiling rubber rat in the state store where I work, but he isn't nearly as menacing as this sucker! In fact's he's kinda friendly. This guy's a beast...blood red eyes, sharp claws, looks like he'd take your throat if you slipped and fell in the bathroom. No ordinary broom neccesary here, friends, no, what you need is a can of mase and a nightstick. Buy this guy, set him in the windows of a dark room, and call the cops. God knows they need some useful stuff to do at night besides drink coffee and play video games. Would get more stars, but he's damn expensive
B000J4FHEQ:don't_bother:meredith_mckinnon	1.0	the box it came in looked like it had been torn apart by a pack of wild dogs when i received it.  fur was falling off of the coat as i pulled it out of the box.  i tried it on just to see if i'd like a replacement since it was not in perfect condition, and it was NOT cute on.  i immediately returned it
B000CSZ9EC:jipped:kevin_t._aponte	1.0	Originally ordered a COMPLETELY different model armband for 15 bux. GOT THIS ONE......we'll see if my 80 gb video will fit.....doubt it....AMAZON....bad call on this seller son!!!
B000CSZ9EC:not_for_the_5th_generation!:p._lintermans	2.0	This case is actually made for fourth generation models and although it is being advertised as being for the fifth, the case is too big for a snug fit. It works, but I didn't spend this money for something that was advertised as being made for the new Ipod. Real scam
B000CSZ9EC:not_worth_the_money:patrick_m._spring	1.0	This is a cheap and flimsy armband.  NOT THE ONE IN THE PICTURE.  There are much better on Amazon for less money
B000686I6G:i_ordered_a_bathrobe_but_got_a_tent.:dr._c._j._lovelace	2.0	The fabric of the bathrobe was wonderful Egyptian cotton, but the bathrobe was huge.  It was more like a tent than a bathrobe.  It was an anniversary present for my wife (size 8) and the bathrobe was one size fits all as long as you wear a size 18.  I was very disappointed that I could not have ordered at least a general size (large, medium or small)
B000JN0ILY:lands_end_price._k-mart_quality.:g._norton	1.0	The phrase "more efficient sourcing" means that Lands End is now buying these in China. The pants arrived with a strange smell (fishy odor), the fit was odd, and, after one washing, the fabric looked bad. They went back ASAP!

I bought khakis from Lands End for over a dozen years until this recent product change. Notice the past tense. Ownership by K-Mart Holdings is definitely making an impact on the company
B000EEHPRI:don't_last_very_long.:highland_fling_"heather"	1.0	The cheaper variety at Walmart ($8.92 versus $19 and up), No Boundaries brand, is better for me due to the fact that they are harder and more firm, more like a Birkenstock cork sole which I also find very comfortable, for me anyway. They do last longer too and are not affected by heat in any way.
Walmart also has a real color explosion going on. You can get some really wild color combinations which give the shoe have a little personality for those occasions when you feel the need to express yourself.

So, for the cheaper price Walmart offers, I feel the value and quality exceeds the more expensive brands out there. If you are looking for a firm Birkestock type sole, the No Boundaries brand Croc is a shoe-in, no pun intended.
B000EEHPRI:don't_wash_your_crox:todd_a._hooper	1.0	I washed 'em and they shrunk up so small I can't wear 'em anymore, bummer
B00008IP9F:gave_me_blisters:melanie_crowe	1.0	I would not reccomend wearing these hose for very long at all. The silicone bands which hold them up were burning my legs by halfway through my wedding day and left me with blisters on my wedding night.
B0007MCPAO:fast_delivery_but_qulity_did_not_meet_my_expectatio.:a._elahi_"aa"	2.0	The fast delivery and reasonable price for these shoes almost make me ignore the not so perfect pair of shoes I received.
They look like some floor model and somewhat tried on with part of the heels on both shoes cut off resembling rejects.
I am sure I will not show them off much when I wear them
B000EXS1IQ:cheesey:robert_brown	1.0	If you like cheap furniture you'll love this boot. The slave labor used to make this boot was wasted
B0002OQDXC:i_wish_i_had_not_bought_it_at_amazon:james_d._vantassel	1.0	The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

Sorry I got a job and not time for petty rules. I will go elsewhere next time
B0009VT6MI:marilyn__satin_dress:jeanette_marshall	2.0	I received the wrong size originally. The company was prompt in sending me another dress, however, I received a third dress which I refused by mail and I am trying to get my credit card adjusted.
 The dress is lovely
B000NGKGVO:green_shuffle_case:m._edens	1.0	I thought the case was nice looking, but when actually using it, I was very dissapointed.  The case is not secure at all, it keeps sliding off.  If you have the little clip on iPod shuffle, I do not recommend the aluminum case
B0000APKTE:cashmere_sweater_??:i._hall_"continental_shopper"	1.0	The quality was very poor, it was very wrinkled and to thin for a mens winter sweater. I send it back
B000A8PNPE:feels_like_paper:missy	1.0	I was very dissatisfied with this purchase.  The material feels like paper and the seams were all crooked.  Then, when I returned it, I got an ugly email.  Keep looking; for the price, you can find something of much better quality
B00022S382:disappointed_with_the_service:stephanie_goh_"steph"	1.0	Never got to wear this Lingerie at all.

Mailed item back for exchange due to a wrong size recieved but no one got back. Sent several emails to check on item for exchange but in the end got a reply saying that they will credit the amount back to my credit card.

Sent another email to emphasise that I requested for an exchange instead of refund but no one got back...

Very Very bad servic
B000A3904Y:cheap:crystal_"crystal"	1.0	Not worth the price at all...
The bead work looks very cheap...
The color does not look the way its shown in the picture.
Decided to return it the moment I opened the box..
B000A3904Y:not_as_nice_looking_as_the_photo:enemies_abound_"purple"	1.0	I received this item as a gift and was disappointed when I pulled it out of the box. It's okay, but not as cute looking as the photo makes it seem. The beads on the hem and chest look nice in the photo, but are rather cheap looking. 
It looks like something I could make myself. Very cheap and plain looking.
B000G6EVGW:bad_product:steven_shepard	1.0	it doesnt fit well. the joystick doesnt function right with it on. the buttons are difficult to use. the product was poorly mad
B000G6EVGW:not_happy_with_product:patricia_a._yeager	1.0	My son wripped his right away trying to put it on his psp & he said it was hard to get to the buttons to play
B000GJR6XO:the_size_don't_match:florentina_ghita	2.0	I ordered this items in size xx-large for my 20 months doughter and there are huge. Maybe will fit when she will be 4 or 5, although she looks normaly for her age
B0002VG2U4:betula_licensed_by_birkenstock_black_suede_clog_size:_37:lilly	2.0	Disappointing. I wear size 37 Birkenstocks and these are one half inch shorter than my other clogs
B0002VG2U4:negative_experience:s._hagy	2.0	After wearing the Betula Birkenstocks for about an hour, the snap button kept coming undone near the buckle.  Happened pretty much every 10 minutes when i walked.  Midwest wont take them back since i wore them.
B000FBNYCU:warm_&_comfortable:bubba_"redneck"	1.0	The length of the jacket could be a little longer...bairly hits the belt
B0002COCO6:these_are_great!:	2.0	Hey! I'm twelve years old and I just want to tell all of you other boys out there that you really need to try these. They feel really nice on the skin and they don't bunch up as easily as boxers and boxer-briefs do. They also give really good support to your penis. They keep it in one place the whole day without the discomfort. Boys, ya'll all seriously need to try these undies out. They're awesome
B0002COCO6:if_you_like_wegies_and_being_panted_get_these:d_eddmen_"d"	1.0	Dont buy parents on less you want to have to remove your kids under wear from there butt's or if you want to tie a chain and lock around there pants so they dont get panted, so dont but these because removing under wear can be award
B0009K5U2Y:so_where_can_you_get_the_panty_pictured?:l._wesolowski_"spacey"	1.0	i too have been searching for the panty in the picture.
i ordered 3 of these and the main difference is the amount of fabric at the highest part of the leg.  there should only be a 1/2 inch of fabric, but there is more like 3 inches...yuk!  ; b
has anyone been able to locate the panties that are pictured?  (the ones that we all seem to love and want)?
please email me personally if u have found them!
sheemna@yahoo.co
B0009K5U2Y:not_what_i_ordered:s._bartlett	1.0	Like every review before mine, my order was wrong as well. The picture is incorrect and needs to be updated. I waited a long time for these items and was disappointed to find a misleading design....yes it's a real hassle to send them back and wait for a refund. I strongly feel that if Amazon was really concerned with customer satisfaction then they would have taken care of this issue sooner. Is this just another big uncaring corporation? This experience has tainted my shopping experience and leads me to not wanting to shop with Amazon for anything again
B0009K5U2Y:not_as_pictured:kathleen_gerlach	1.0	I ordered these based on the picture---a high cut brief. These are not the ones they sent me and now I have to pay to return them! Rip off!!! Zero stars
B0009K5U2Y:item_not_as_pictured:f._w._harris	1.0	My wife has purchased and worn this style for many years; however, the items received were nothing like the picture.  The pictured item was exactly what she wanted, lace waistband AT (not below) her waist and high-cut leg openings; the delivered item was an entirely different style with an entirely different (and unsatisfactory) fit.  She'd opened all the items to check them individually before discovering that items had to be unopened and in the original shipping packaging in order to be accepted for return
B0009K5U2Y:underwear:kari_j._schulte	1.0	The item that is PICTURED is the item that I wanted and ordered. However, the item that is described and that I received (Halfpant), is NOT what is pictured. What is pictured is a hi-cut pant. I did not realize this until I received the order, and was greatly disappointed. I had to send everything back. You are misrepresenting what you are selling by having the incorrect picture of the item. I actually would give this 0 stars, but the computer would not allow that.
B000COYKN2:quality_matches_price:shizzys	1.0	This was a poorly made product.  Even when left still on a table, North took about 2 min to locate - something unusable for most people who are out on the run and need to know where North is, NOW.  Also it advertises a thermometer on the packaging, but there wasn't one I could find.  I ended up returning this for a full refund
B0002TW0JS:fluffies_don't_hold_up:james_a._barry_"jbarry"	2.0	Based on the prior reviews, I fully expected to like these. Unfortunately, I don't, and won't buy more. They don't stay up. I don't have particularly large or small calves, and don't have that issue with my other athletic socks. Oh, well, buy and learn.

I bought both white and black and they are equally disappointing
B0002TW0JS:very_uncomfortable:j._bickmore	1.0	These socks have an excess of thread bundled at the corners of the toe seams. If this sort of design bothers you (as it does me), then these are not the socks for you. These socks cause a lot of discomfort for me
B000F7R2MC:not_very_quality:julie_mallory_"julie"	2.0	I would not buy this sweater.  It is flimsy, and not very quality feeling.  The price was too good to be true
B000GX7CSO:red_wallet_review:jordyn_l._hines_"still_wallet-less"	2.0	I found the wallet to be cheap looking and MUCH smaller than the picture lead me to believe.  To call this a wallet is a gross misrepresentation of the actual product.  This is more of an insert to a wallet, consisting of a few card places and a small zippered pocket.  I wasn't pleased with the purchased, expecting quite a bit more the $14 I spent.  I can go to Target and get a wallet for less that what I paid for this one and it will be a FULL wallet, not a sorry wannabe
B000JVC9WM:poor_quality:green_giant	1.0	After one washing, the letters were all rolled up. I was able to pull the rest of it off and now it is just a grey onesie. The quality of the graphic was horrible
B000FCN9JW:very_poorly_designed.:jessica_a._heironimus_"j._heironimus"	1.0	The upper portion of the boots which is supposed to hug your calf is ridiculously huge.  The shoe portion fit.  I have relatively normal-sized calves and I was swimming in these boots.  I immediately returned tham
B0002LI8J2:big_mistake!:robert_l._fishell	1.0	These underwear were supposed to be size 34, but I could barely shimmy them up over my legs.  The fit was so tight that I could not wear them, even though all my other underwear is size 34 and fits fine. They are also made of a very thin and flimsy grade of cotton, and the fly does not provide enough overlap to keep everything where it belongs.  If you must try these, buy them at least 2 sizes larger - but you would do better with another product
B0001HYN3W:awful_and_uncomfortable:anonymous_"anonymous"	1.0	Awful fit!  I usually love wacoal petites because they are generally a perfect fit for me, HOWEVER, the mesh on this one is terrible because it rolls.  At first I thought it was the size so I purchased another and found the same issue.  Steer clear of this model
B000B7PQJ2:silly_goose:peter_huynh_"collector_x"	2.0	slippers finally arrived and i was a little bit dissapointed. construction was cheap, goose fill was light and overall flimsy. if you want to wear it twice, then thats what its worth
B000ITUEQ8:very_disappointed!!:j.perez	1.0	I've purchased several of these bras in the past from Qvc as their ad states and was surprised to see it so cheap here. Though I was suspicious, I ordered one anyway. Not surprisingly, the cups puckered when I tried it on. Never had this problem with any ordered from QVC. When I inquired about returning it, I was disappointed to find they have a no return policy (though not posted anywhere I could find easily). 

I believe this company sells '2nds' though does not advertise that fact.

I will not purchase from this company again, and I am now leery about purchasing through Amazon in general
B0002V396Y:too_sheer:nikki	2.0	i bought this product several weeks ago. they looked nice but they are extremely sheer. they ripped right away which was very disappointing
B000BNPN3U:no_luv_from_luvable_friends_-_poor_quality:j._gottlieb	1.0	I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old.  Luvable Friend's onsies are awful.  The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies.  And the velcro doesn't even stick.  They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes.  Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son.  Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!
B00078SICW:don't_buy_these_shirts:nick	1.0	I bought a bunch of these shirts because I saw the good reviews. At first I was happy, they fit perfect, then I washed them once in cold water and they shrunk more than I ever seen shirts shrink in my life. My medium shirts became XXS. I wish I had a 8 year old son, because he would be the only person that would be able to fit in them now
B0007ZDTDI:deluxe_check_book_cover:gabriel_j._roldan	1.0	Found the item to be poorly designed. Did not fit my checks or recorder. Item is useless unless you use checks with side tear
B0009VGI9M:nicely_slimming_but_straps_don't_help_much:t._delarosby	1.0	Like the last reviewer said it's tricky to put on using the little straps that go around your bra...that is a FACT. A front closure bra might help some. Even though I (finally and after a lot of cussing) got the straps around my bra, the garment still gapped underneath the bra on both sides of the back strap, which is right in the middle. That is the only place in the back there is a strap to hold the whole back of the girdle up. 

Then there is one strap under each arm that goes around your bra there. It pulled down on my bra there causing scrunching. There is one strap in front in the middle too, which I don't need to use. 

The directions say to attach the Spanx/straps to the bra and 'step' into the garment. RIGHT!! Much easier said than done.

For it to stay up properly in the back I think it needs straps not only right in the middle, but also to the left and right of the middle, in between that and the under the arm ones. I can't really use mine...A waste of money, I already removed the tags and can't send it back. I have another Spanx that is the same but without the little straps and I can't use that either, as it does creep down in the back. Unless you don't MOVE that is. So altogether I have spent about $150 for Spanx stuff I can't use.

There must be a better way to fasten those straps....maybe sturdy SNAPS or velcro or something, and they should  fasten right to the TOP edge of the garment, as it is they hook half an inch down on the inside and that causes the top edge to tend to roll out and cause bulk there.

Not happy
B0002MEVJM:things_went_wrong!:p._cleveland	2.0	Have purchased from this seller in the past with zero problems. This time was different. They sent the wrong shorts. I paid the shipping to send them back. I asked, please send the right shorts. They credited my account an amount smaller than I paid. And that was that. Certainly not satisfied.
B000B0SNV2:cant_review_it__because_it_was_never_shipped:an_avid_movie_buff	1.0	I received an email from amazon asking me to review this item I had purchased.  This item never arrived from Macy's.  I emailed them and they said they would ship it immediately and I would have it in ten business days.  3 weeks later I still didnt have the item.  I contacted them back and was advised the item is no longer available.  My account was ( reportedly ) credited but poor service on this item
B0007QCNGG:sizing_is_misleading_-_beware!:kathy_n-v_"buried_in_amazon_boxes"	1.0	I found these shoes by searching the women's option for running shoes.  The name may say Unisex, but there is no indication that the sizing is 100% male.  Not even a note stating that a woman should subtract 2 or 3 or 10 sizes from her normal shoe size. 

When the shoes arrived here, they were huge. I tried to return them, but Amazon considers this to be MY fault, and planned to charge back any shipping, promotions and coupons against a possible refund.  I had done very well using a coupon, a sale, a "buy $80 worth of shoes and get $20 off instantly" promotion and Amazon prime, so my "refund" would be less than nothing. 

That's right -- if I return the shoes, I owe money.  Because Amazon made no mention that shoes found in the women's section of the site might be men's shoes instead.  Yeah, that seems fair
B000659XY8:nice_looking_but_._._.:susanna_hutcheson_"see_http://www.powerwriting.com"	2.0	A beautiful checkbook cover that even has a pen holder. But the problem is when I put the checks in (regular sized) the cover will not lay flat. Perhaps it will after awhile but I've never had a checkbook cover do this before. I can't recommend this item
B000EF1X3E:shirt_runs_very_small!:m._grice	1.0	I purchased this shirt for my golfer mom for Christmas and had to return it.  I bought an XL because she normally wears a 16, but the shirt was about the right size for me (an 8).  The quality seemed to be fine, but the sizing was very misleading
B000A09ZXI:nice_leather,_god_awful_construction:aaron_levy_"-sparc"	1.0	The leather on these gloves is soft and supple. and they're warm

thats about all that I can say that is good. There were scuffs when I got them. the stitching was ripping (and finished itself off soon after) and the fingers were different lengths on each glove. avoid at all costs.

B000A3NPOK:hot_little_corset:ashley_fahey_"ashleydawn"	2.0	i bought this dress because i thought it looked so good on the model in the photo, but i should have taken into consideration i couldnt see the front. The boobs on the dress were very weird and pointy, and the ties up the back looked awful. It might be good for someone with a different figure than mine, but i think my boyfriend would have been more amused than aroused if he had seen me in it
B000FM14DU:not_the_best_quality_but_a_very_kind_company:r._röser_"potter"	2.0	It was very kind of the company to refund the items when i had to send them back. But the quality of the shirts where not the quality i am used to have when i buy orginal Van Heusen shirts
B000B8KA6K:very_disappointed:r._davis	2.0	This was my second time ordering a Dickies jacket and being disappointed, I will not do it again. The zipper gets stuck on a flap of material almost everytime I zip or unzip it.
   I contacted Andrew Christian over ninety days ago by e-mail and I was ignored. Today I decided to send him a message through Amazon and found out it was to late. I thought that the time limit was 180 days.
   I like everything else about the jacket, but this problem has cost me a lot of time and frustration, there must be a better brand for my money somewhere out there
B000GJU81G:kenneth_cole_reaction_women's_cos_i_stretch_boot_:d._perkins	1.0	These boots where definitely a disappointment from Kenneth Cole. They did not resemble leather in the least.  They looked terrible on me; maybe there is someone out there that they would look good on.
B0001J3Z2U:not_exactly_as_pictured:john_delano	2.0	Be warned that the business card side is deep enough to hold 50 cards.  I bought this wallet only to hold a few credit cards, my ID and some cash.  Hence, there is a lot of wasted space in my wallet.  From the picture, it looks as though the business card side is just a slot. Whereas, in reality, it is actually a pouch (like most of the other card holders).  Other drawbacks are that there is some filler underneath the leather to make it look smoother (which takes up quite a bit of space), the leather itself is very low quality, and the wallet does not close well even without anything in it.  Furthermore, on the inside of the wallet there is a large white tag stating that it was Made in China.  I mean, China is great and all but if you're on a date and you say "Hey, let me pay for this," and you pull out your credit card and a large white tag protrudes with it saying Made in China, well, you are pretty much a schmuck (I cut mine out with a pair of scissors, but there are still some remnants).  So if you like being low class, by all means, buy this wallet.  I personally don't care about my wallet very much so I am keeping it and going to use it, but I almost returned it.  It is most definitely a solid 2 stars.  Hope this helps
B0002OQDXM:i_wish_i_had_not_bought_it_at_amazon:james_d._vantassel	1.0	The robe does not fit me. I wanted to return it, got a return item number, got busy, and did not get it in the mail soon enough. They have a strict 30 day return ploicy. Nordstroms does not do this. I could exchange it there.

B000G0124M:color_not_the_same_:d._worl	2.0	i bought a green ipod scok, thinking the it would be that same as the picture they show at the top of the page, but it ended up having a lighter green than what they showed and what i wanted.
B000G0124M:this_is_not_genuine_ipod_sock:sun_devil	2.0	Even though it works just fine like Ipod Ipod sock, it's quite disappointed that this is not a genuine one. It's acceptable thoug
B000A3NOZU:whole_thing_runs_small:s/e_lenz_"edenza"	2.0	I ordered what should be my size and what is my size in all my other lingerie. There's there's zero stretch in this, it was difficult to get the panties over the hips and then the waist is big. Since they're short from crotch to waist anyway, it doesn't much matter.

The top fits better, since you adjust it. The cut is still quite poor and, again, there's no give to the silk so it feels tight across the shoulders. It's one thing for lingerie to be snug in the hips or bust. It's another when the cut is so bad that the shoulders are a problem.

If you're narrow through the hips, shoulders or bust, this combo will probably be a nice fit. If you're curvy, you might want to rethink this. It's a shame since it comes in plus sizes. Maybe I should have ordered up about two sizes but it should have been better made and a truer fit IMO
B0006TP0ZU:no_support,_ughhhhhhh,_also_didn't_last.......:janet_d._"rock_goddess"	1.0	I had purchased this bra, it was recommended by a fitter, so I tried it on, it felt comfortable enough.  I am a 36 DD, after 3 wearrings all I did was sag, it did not hold it's shape, and I hand wash all my lingerie.  This is the worst bra, and very pricey.  Makes you look  wide, not a very good garment, for me anyway..

TRY THE CHAMPION 1123 for the ultimate support and comfort, great t shirt bra, there is also a racer back by wacoal that is great also.

This one I hated and I had purchased more than one, just wore them till they DIED, and they DIED fast...

I truly  beleive in the BALI bra, VF is good to, after 6 months you have to replace all bras anyway, why spend more than $40.00...

Thanks, hope this helped...
B000F3JGCK:no_product_to_review!:windywyogirl_"lyn"	1.0	I returned this bra to exchange for size the day after I received it in October.  It is now January and I have not yet received the replacement.  I have called several times but to no avail!  I can't give a good review of this product because I haven't actually gotten to wear the bra
B000F3JGCK:pretty_but_petty:satisfaction	2.0	Buying this was a mistake. This bra lifts up exposing half my breats which is visible under a shirt. The straps are not comfortable, it's cuts deep into the shoulders-it should be atleast padded. Def. not what I expected from this product. The material and pattern is the only thing I liked; it has a sexy look to it
B000AYD9A4:horrible_and_horrifying_fit_and_quality!!!!!!:vicki_m._wagner	1.0	I had several of these shipped to my Mum in law's in California for sending to me in France where we work and live. Because of a decent delivery speed, and her thinking they looked OK, I gave them a rating of 5 Stars.

Today, after even having BOILED them in water, hoping for shrinkage, I am sad to say that nothing happened.

They are horrid to wear, I oredered a medium size and the fit is that of XXXXXXXL.

DO NOT BUY THIS HORRORS. I wish I could get my hard earned money back, as now I'm wondering if I was the brunt of a joke in Nightmare Alley.

You've got to be con artist to sell these things
B0000AKGHI:not_impressed....:anonymous	1.0	I did not expect the Jockey to not show any lines but there was absolutely no difference between these and a regular pair of bikini. These should be renamed Jockey Show-Everything Bikini
B000JUEV5Q:pashmina_shawl:k._engels_"kristy"	1.0	The shawl is very thin, not good quality, I suspect it is not cashmere at all, but some kind of a mixture of cheap wools. The color was supposed to be expresso, not even that promise was fulfilled, it is a much lighter brown. I do not recommend this shawl at all

B000J3H588:ouch!_:shoeaddict	1.0	These shoes are cute but not practical at all. I generally wear high heals 4 inches and even more but these are the most painful shoes I have ever tried on. I ordered these and the peep-toe sling back version. These are really narrow in the two, my foot feels so constricted in there, they totally cut off your circulation. And forget about even trying to walk in these. Very poorly constructed. The peepttoe slings however are great, fit true to size and are comfortable.
B000J3H588:not_true_to_size:beth_vander_meulen	2.0	I think that these shoes are very sassy, but I ran into one problem ordering them online...they aren't true to their size.  I always wear a 6 1/2 but after putting these on, my feet were asleep after about 10 minutes.  Order wisely

B0002NZN8E:not_recommended.:b._lawrence	1.0	I purchased 5 of the Anvil SS Henleys in assorted colors not long ago.  Out of the box, they were good quality.  After 2 washes, however, they have shrunk drastically to the point that they cannot be tucked in anymore.  My personal opinion... waste of money
B000ASGL1Y:different_color_shade_of_leather_:s._yeong_"simon_y"	2.0	Was disappointed with the color of the shoe, because there is a difference between the left and right shoe.

At first i thought the wrong models were packed in the box.
But no, it's the shade of the leather that is different, left shoe is darker than the right shoe.

Being in Singapore, it will be expensive for me to ship back for replacement. (I had the shoe delivered to my Brother-in-law in L.A., who brought it back to Singapore for me

B000FBX092:not_that_great:pa_student	2.0	I just bought 5 pairs of dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) and was very disappointed. I picked Dickies because they were cute, cheaper than most, and seemed like they would last. The colors are really nice, but the light pastel colors are almost see-through. I tried them on and was able to see my patterned underpants through the scrubs. The ankles are tapered, not obnoxiously so, but definitely tapered. The medium bottoms have a HUGE amount of extra fabric in the belly. The fabric is rough, and feels like plastic
B000FCP18E:very_disappointed:c._cooper	1.0	I have ordered this coat 2 times and returned both coats.  I'm very disappointed.  This is supposed to be a reversible coat.  However, the hem of the black side is too long. Consequently it hangs below the hem of the bronze side when reversed.  And, it does not look good at all.  The company needs to revise this pattern
B0007VS6CG:maidenform_lace_tanga_pants:m._j._french	1.0	These were a waste of money.  They were not properly designed to cover ANYTHING, much less my backside, even though I did order what SHOULD have been the right size.  I realize I have a lot to cover, but I ordered a size that was supposed to do the trick.  I've still got a pair in white that I haven't even opened!  And won't!  It would be a waste of energy!
B000M4W72I:terrible_quality,_cheap_looking_jacket:lori_larsen_"clothes-luvr"	1.0	Coat was of VERY cheap quality. The fur around hood was matted. No way I would wear or recommend this coat.  It went staight to Good Will. I guess you get what you pay for.  Unless it is free you are paying too much
B0001ZMD4A:not_what_i_expected:t._murray_"not_yet_a_bookworm"	2.0	After seeing the photo and reading the other reviews I thought this would be a good buy. I'm not really thrilled about this jacket. It's a flimsy rain jacket and not a stormbreaker. It doesn't have that good quality lining that gives jackets that heavy feel. This is something you can easily find at Walmart on sale for $9.99.
B0002FHFQ0:xl__???__whatever!:s._klein_"max's_mom"	1.0	I must not have read the fine print!  This shirt MUST be a childs size.  It just fit.  Then one wash and way too small.  How can this be considered an XL???
B00070PG5C:not_recommended.:george	1.0	I bought this Speedo because I like its new strechy fabric and the handsome design. The biggest problem is that the 1-inch wide elastic band can not stay flat on my waist after a few uses. I own several Speedo swimming trunks, this one is the worst. If the band can be improved, I will rank it at least 3 stars.

B0002OJ6X6:land's_end_is_alienating_its_loyal_customers:janeite_joan	1.0	I agree with what others have said about the re-designed Sport Knit Pants. I had been happily buying the tapered-leg cotton sport knit pants for at least a dozen years when Lands End decided to start making them with a wide straight leg instead, presumably because some customers had requested the newer look.  Maybe I'm wrong, but I think most people who are looking for the latest fashion aren't going to suddenly start shopping at Lands End. And it seems to me that if a few customers are requesting a new style, the company should make a new, ADDITIONAL product in that style, rather than re-design a product which, according to Lands End's own descriptions, was a perennial customer favorite.  I returned the new pants and this formerly loyal Lands End customer is now shopping elsewhere
B0002OJ6X6:they_shrink,_they_fade,_no_matter_what_you_do:mrs._entity	1.0	I bought 5 pairs, had to return 1 because the legs were different lengths.  The 4 remaining were much too long--the ends of the pants were under my heels.  I knew they'd shrink, but despite washing them in cold water and drying them on medium or low, they barely reach my ankle bone.  I like my pants longer than that. And they've faded to navy blue, even though I used Woolite for dark laundry.  Nothing else has faded as much as these pants.

Also, they're lighter weight than they used to be.  I used to be able to wear these all winter long in southern New England, and they were warm enough for just about anything.  Now the wind whistles through them.

Sorry, Land's End; I'll try LL Bean next time
B0002OJ6X6:disappointed._:aussiemeg	1.0	I have purchased these beloved sport pants for years. The cut of these pants has been changed with this order. The quality of the cut and fabric is much lower now. I returned the item
B0002OJ6X6:if_it_ain't_broke_-_don't_fix_it!:mary_lincoln_"mollie_ollie"	1.0	I've been buying Land's End Sport Knit Pants for over 15 years (Land's End clothing for much longer).  They've redesigned these COMPLETELY (and are doing this to all of their women's pants).  Don't be fooled into thinking you'll be getting what you used to order.  Also, this resizing / redesigning of women's pants is systemic.  LL Bean is discontinuing their similar Perfect Fit Pants and having all of their pants (knit or otherwise) resized / redesigned.  Here's just a few of their improvements?

Among the changes:  The waist band (height/width) has shrunk from 1.5 inches to 1.0 inches.  It now rolls!  Fun - not!
Next, the waist band circumference has been enlarged from 26 inches (=/- .5 inch) relaxed (when not being worn) to a whopping 28 to 29 inches!  

It was great fun to put on the ones I ordered, and even after washing them, I thought I must have changed bodies overnight.  The waist just hung.....  Dare I put anything in the pockets and they would have slid down.  When I tried walking in them, that's exactly what happened and I was constantly having to pull them back up.  I had to pin the waist to keep them on...

That's not all the changes.....

They've enlarged the bottom legs by FOUR (4) inches!  No more slightly tapered leg.

The front rise has SHRUNK from 12.5 to 11.5.  If I wanted my belly button to show, I'd go pull out a pair of my 70's hip huggers.....

The back rise has INCREASED from 15 to nearly 16 inches. Did my rear suddenly increase in size?  I think not.

They claim it is also a more substantial knit at 7.3 oz.(old was 6.7 oz).  The ones I am returning are LESS substantial - especially if you stretch them and can see through them which you can't with my old ones.

Next, it seems they have also extended the inseam length.  It was 32 inches on the old sport knit pants before washing - about 31.5 after.  The ones I received AFTER BEING WASHED had inseams measuring nearly 33 inches.

Finally, as if I wasn't feeling self conscious enough about my bod, the pants have been narrowed in the hips and thighs.

Do you get the picture?  The waist sags and rolls.  The seat is major baggy.  My belly button shows.  They have to stretch across my hips so there's those stupid horizontal lines where they pull at the crotch.  They are sucked tight to my thighs, then ballon out from my knees to the feet.  They're too long, so you can't even see my feet.

I spent 30 minutes on the phone with a "specialist" at Land's End and she couldn't explain why all the changes.  That's also where I got all of the above NEW specs.  Also, spoke with a specialist at LL Bean and their NEW specs are identical.

I spend so much each year with Land's End that I get a gift and card at Chrismas from them.  So, I'm not a casual purchaser of their product.

BUYER BEWARE AND GET THE NEW SPECS BEFORE YOU BUY A PRODUCT YOU THINK YOU KNOW AND CAN RELY ON. YOU CAN"T.

IF YOU ARE A LAND'S END or LL BEAN CUSTOMER - CALL THEM AND COMPLAIN.  THEY'VE DONE THIS IN THE PAST, THEN HAD TO BRING BACK THE "OLD" VERSION.

SO, IT WASN'T BROKE Land's End was always sold out or back ordered on their sport knit pants) SO WHOSE DIM-BULB IDEA WAS IT TO "FIX" THEM????

B000JRJDIE:not_as_good_as_it_looks:ms._a._l._forward-preedy_"cadillac"	2.0	I bought this for my husband. We tried it in one car and it kept getting stuck in the lighter socket and the end kept coming off (it wasn't screwed very tightly and couldn't be screwed tighter). In the other car it fit in the socket all right but every couple of minutes you had to adjust the radio station and even then the music came through fuzzy. Also, if you turned the car off it doesn't remember which station it was tuned to. We are going to return it to Amazon, but I'm not sure how as I don't think they have an option for returning it as 'the product just isn't very good!' If you want something cheap and are ok with it not being particularly reliable then this is for you, but for hardcore music lovers, I suggest savinf up and investing in a better product.
B00006X99Q:poor_quality:traildog	1.0	I bought this shirt last yr for my husband. It lasted about 6 months. Much pilling (those horrid dots all over the fabric),and seams coming un-done. After about 3 washings, it looked like I had bought it at Goodwill, used. I wouldn't even give it a 1 star rating. Plus, you will get advertisments in your snail mail from this company FOREVER. Their advertisments/photos cater to gay men.Get ready to see some very unusual attire.

All attempts failed. Very unhappy with product. I have learned

B00086HEZA:narrower_than_other_adidas_of_the_same_size!:ian_r._kelley	1.0	I bought these shoes on a whim from Amazon, and was very disappointed and returned them.  I normally wear size 10M from Adidas, as I do with my Metrum shoes and SuperStar IIs.  Yet with these shoes, size 10M is WAY TOO SMALL, and quite painful.  They were returned...  If you order them, make sure you get a larger/wider size
B00086HEZA:terrible_shoes!!!:ss_"ss"	1.0	I got the shoes for a while and I must say it was a total disappointment! The look and heel were ok, so does the GTX XCR. However, there is a major problem: the shoes won't hold your foot! The opens for the shoes lace (the tounge) are too big so the shoes won't hold your foot intact. This is potential big problem if you really want to hike with it since your foot will just have extra fraction due to the insecure of the foot in the shoe. Hate it ever since I put it on. I have total of 3 pairs of GTX hikers now and this one is the one I regret to out money in
B00086HEZA:incorrect_color_sent..:w._smith_"wizzlesmizzle"	1.0	Don't get me wrong these are nice high end shoes, however, I was sent an ugly red color instead of the yellow displayed on the products site. Nowhere on the products site was the (red) "Outdoor Plein Air" color shown as a choice
B00086HEZA:amazon_misrepresented_item:pin_chieh_chen	1.0	incorrect color was shown on the website.  it has since been added but it wasnt at the time of my purchase.
B00008IDJZ:great_when_on_ear:hank_yee	1.0	Great concept, but they slip off my ears way too often. Often enough that I stopped wearing them
B0006TT0E2:a_big_disapoinment:hallie_engel	2.0	Ok, I don't why this bra is available in any size larger than a B cup, because it just does not provide the needed support for women with a larger bust (I see that is available here in 38 DD, and I shudder to think of anyone built thusly wearing this flimsy thing).  It's comfortable enough to be worn around the house, under jammies, for a little support when just relaxing, but if you are looking for something to hold you in place through the day, this bra won't do it.  The front closure just doesn't allow for any lift or support.  Unless you possess a smaller chest, skip this one
B000LOME4A:blank_apparel_is_awful:jill_grundfest	1.0	I bought a sweatshirt from them--the tote was a "freebie" and too small for much use anyway.

Customer service was awful. They sent me the wrong size--a man's size, not the woman's I was searching for (and the photo had a woman wearing it!  She must have been an Amazon).  I returned it the next day and they REFUSED to accept the return, saying it looked worn
B0009R21Y2:i_should_have_kept_looking.:pam	1.0	The shirt was beautiful.  Notice I used the past tense verb "was"?  After hand washing it twice the hem came out, the front tie fell off, and the side of the lace ripped open.  It found a new home in the trash.
B0009R21Y2:stupid_sizing:mrs._slim	1.0	This is a beautiful dress but it would not fit me, or most people I know.  36" bust, 33" waist and 41" hip?  FAT FAT FAT!  What about us tall slim people
B0009R21Y2:not_as_pictured:heather_murray	2.0	I've ordered from this seller before and the dress I recieved from the previously was perfect. While delivered promptly, this dress was not as it was pictured.

The bodice of the dress is barely ruched at all and ends up giving the appearance of being lumpy and ill-fitting. unless i wanted to put several hours into altering it, it's basically too unflattering to wear.
B00099D3C4:not_worth_it:e._waller	2.0	I got this because I thought it was a good deal, but the clothes weren't very cute and weren't good quality.  I gave them all away, I don't recommend
B0002U39M4:very_disappointed:zodiac_zoo_"zz"	1.0	I purchased these sox for my husband who has Parkinson's Disease, and has trouble putting on sox. (The disease has limited his finger dexterity.)  The sox came in a package of six pair.  I opened the package and we tried to get them on his feet.  It was difficult as the sox did not stretch.  At the end of the day I had to help him take them off.  After washing them I found they shrunk so much he could not wear them at all.  I looked into returning them but because they came in a six pack I could not do so.  I ended up giving them to a charity.  This is the only time Amazon has disappointed me.  I decided to only use Amazon for books, not other products.
B000AOP89E:i_couldn't_believe_these_were_clarks:rubi	1.0	I have several pairs of Clarks shoes that are wonderful.  The Lalita is very uncomfortable.  They are stiff and the sides that come over the foot are stiff and rub.  I was truly disappointed
B000A8MOKG:do_not_hold_up:mover_"mover"	1.0	I bought 2 of these least year. First the ID info came off enroute, then the green rollup part came off coming back. Will not purchase again
B0002TV0M6:okay_socks..should_have_stuck_with_cotton.:christopher_parker_"ugarxdawg"	2.0	This my first pair of 100% nylon socks.  The problem I have is that my feet cannot breathe in them.  My socks are wet after a full day wearing them. I guess I'll just have to stay with cotton...I've never had that problem before with cotton/polyester socks. They do stay up above my calf all day long, though.
B000768EXW:cheap_thin_scratchy!:t._j.	1.0	This set is made of thin scratchy cheap fabric!  There is no shape to the gown...AWFUL
B000E9VFWO:save_your_money_and_get_real_birks:shasta's_d	2.0	I bought a pair of these thinking they were only different in upper strap material. The footbed/sole is not cork like true Birks, but some sort of composite (rigid). Birk straps are softer and Birk corkbeds are more cushiony.

I wore them around the house to see if they were comfortable and the footbed became marked - just from an hour or so. Too bad because after that I knew I didn't like them. I tried on a pair of Birk Granada (the style this is based on) and immediately felt the difference. 

While these are about 30%-50% cheaper, I would have rather spent more on the original Birks. I think these won't hold up as long and don't offer the same comfort. Also, you can have real Birks "repaired" so they never really wear out.

**Black version has large "Betula" on side in white
B00064VJP0:strap_breaks_on_first_use:carolyn_j._white	1.0	Extremely disappointed in this bag.  It wasn't even heavily loaded, just some folders with papers, keys, phone, make up, wallet.  On the very first use the strap broke before I even got home.  Also, the stitching is coming loose.  Also the strap is not leather.  A big waste of money.
B000B5ZOXM:plastic_bag.:larry_w._sebert	2.0	I didn't pay much for these, so I had to give them 2 stars instead of 1 just for the value aspect. Wearing these pants is like putting on a plastic bag. They repel water from the outside just fine, but they also keep it in. They might be fine if you do not exert yourself at all during the time you wear them, but that is hard to do. In a pinch, go for it, otherwise, invest in something better. I certainly would not ever recommend trying to ride a bicycle in them
B00070PFZS:read_the_sizing_chart:r._rivero_"not_happy"	2.0	I purchased one of this bikinis a couple of years ago and it lasted about 4 years before it turned into a transparent suit.I ordered 2 suits through amazon.com, but to my surprise the size 34 that I ordered in reallity is a size 28, which makes it very unconfortable to wear. So becareful when ordering. Look at the manufacturer's sizing list (VERY SMALL LETTERS) to find the right size. By the way, I had to pay to return these items because I did not read the manufaturer's sizing chart.  Not a happy camper
B0000A6QL7:nice_look_-_not-so-nice_feel:amber_r	2.0	I purchased two of these sports bras based on brand, price, and product description. This is a very uncomfortable bra for runners. The seams chafe and it does not "wick away moisture."  The slow shipping didn't help my opinion either. It is a nice bra for less active endeavors.
B000E77IS6:i_returned_these_shoes.:keb	1.0	One shoe did not fit properly--also didn't think the sole would be comfortable for all day walking
B000E8FF44:disappointed:elaine_b._rossi	1.0	I purchased these sandals thinking they would be comfortable
and because they looked like they were made of leather.
They are more like a vinyl material and are stiff and not
attractive.  They will be returned.
B000E8FF44:review_of_naturalizer_shoes:robin_m._abernathy	2.0	First of all, they look cheaper than I thought they would look.  But the most important thing is that they are very uncomfortable across the TOP of my foot.  In other words, the straps at the top rub against the top of my foot, and caused blisters.  I am hoping that if I keep trying to wear them, the "leather" will soften up and become easier to wear
B000H8H9PO:magic_wand:s._smith	2.0	I guess you get what you pay for. the wand was cheaply made and the shipping doubled the price of the item. It reminded me more of what I would find in my cat's litter box than a magical device
B000F876RC:poor_fit:f._sweet	2.0	In my case, the boots were not quite true to size and definitely not wide enough. My feet ARE size 14 and EEE width (but some EE made on wide lasts can fit). The boots that I received were marked 14 EE but wouldn't even allow my feet half way in. I wish they fit because they look good, the quality is good, and price unbeatable. However, I lost $8.50 at the UPS when I sent them back
B000M2VYU6:wrong_item,_no_service:h._lee	1.0	I received wrong item, but there was no service after that
B0009C8J4S:it_is_a_shame:r._easterling	2.0	I take no pleasure in this review.  I just received (March 2007) my 3rd pair of Vasque Sundowners. I'd used up my GTX Sundowners (4th pair of Vasque boots) that I've had for about 3 years.  This is the first pair that squeaks.  I like good shoes, and I like taking care of them.  I had always been proud to wear Vasque, but the quality of these is just not that great.  The leather is thinner, and is dimpling, so they even look cheaper.  It's a shame, I wish Red Wing (another brand I`ve enjoyed in the past) had not acquired Vasque. It is the end of a great tradition
B000AXYOHW:shoulder_pads:m._beaton	1.0	I ordered a small, it is huge and has shoulder pads that are on my elbow
B0007ZFV7U:reminds_me_of_one_of_those_leather_kits_i_had_when_i_was_10:chester_"chester"	2.0	My mouth dropped when i received this item.  the inside is like raw material and the piece that holds the money down is not easy to use.  For clarity it has 2 outside pockets and no inside pockets
B00009AK5H:a_good_review:anne_schneider	1.0	The bra came well packed, speedily and it is very like the picture and description.  The fit is good
B00065I9ZM:nice_looking_but_falls_short-:matthew_j._rock_"amzon_shopper_68"	1.0	Verynice looking however I had to return mine because the plastic separator that keeps your writing from bleeding through to the next checks carbon copy was about a quarter inch too short and did not cover the date on the checks.
It was also a bit on the thin side so even if it did cover the date I'm not so sure it would keep someone who write's a little harder than the norm from getting bleed through writing.
Side note- would be a little nicer looking if the corners were rounded instead of square but would have kept it if the other hadn't been a problem.
The service was excellent from Belt Outlet.
Arrived in a normal amount of time.. Very courteous when I called and explained why I would be returning
B000FLXAT2:not_bad,_but_not_what_i_expected:r._hom	2.0	The scarf is out of good material and is the size and color stated.  I have two problems with the scarf:
     1.  I thought "sheer" meant sheer.
     2.  I expected the edges to be finished (hemmed)
B000CECOJE:disappointing_christmas_present:karen_l._whisnant	1.0	I purchased this scarf as a Christmas present for my daughter-in-law.  It was so cheap and thin it was mailed to me folded up in a 9 x 12 envelope.  I had to go out at the last minute and purchase a scarf at a department store.  I would have been embarrassed to give her the Pashmina scarf.  It was a wasted of money
B000LORBFM:itchy:hilarie_i._ormsby	1.0	I want to help overseas products, but this advertises itself as cashmere. IT ITCHES MY NECK! Cashmere does not itch. Color was not represented appropriately
B0007OPIM4:generic_problem_with_amazon's_photographic_displays:new_zealander	1.0	The views do not show the belt and buckle. I cannot tell from the photos if the buckle closes in the middle or is offset to the side.

Why does this matter? For me, it's vital information. When I'm backpacking I carry my glasses/camera/pen/notebook in a fanny pack. Of course the backpack waistband buckle is in the middle, over the navel. If the fanny pack buckle is also in the middle then the two buckles interfere with each other.

A few manufacturers are wise to this conflict. They make fanny packs with the buckle closure offset--between the left hip bone and the navel. The two waistband buckles do not interfere with each other.

I won't be considering this product because I cannot discern the photograph
B000CRG0UA:horrible_quality!:e._waller	1.0	These bootie/slippers are terrible.  They don't EVER stay on, there's no anti-skid on the bottom and are cheaply made.  I would give these 0 stars if I could, it was a complete waste of money- don't bother getting these regadless of how inexpensive they are
B000CRG0UA:slip_right_off:angel_by_the_coast	1.0	These booties are very cute and soft, but they just slip right off my son's feet.  They do not have a way to secure the 'tongue' part of the bootie when you cinch up the velcro and as soon as baby moves their feet, the 'tongue' part just pulls right out.  Not a good value for the money.
B0002V2ZDM:pretty_good:t._behere	2.0	Good socks. , nice material. but on the second day of using them one sock had a tiny hole in it. They are knee high and stay up, provide good warmth in the cold weather
B0002V2ZDM:2.5_stars:nickie	2.0	Ibought these socks for the purported thermal heating qualities. I was still cold. Just a regular average socks, easy to wash and dry so great for travelling, nothing more
B000HW21ZS:never_recieved:ray_d._cupps_"racer"	1.0	This item was cancelled by Amazon because of a price mistake that they would not honor after taking my order.very poor customer servic
B000CFERYS:very_hard_to_keep_clean!:elizabeth_sippel	2.0	Well I guess the title says most of it. I am not happy with them they turn a dark brown just walking across the yard so I have to put them in the washing machine with bleach A LOT. Then the place where the laces go at the top are all frayed. I've tried to was them by hand with bleach so it wont fry but it dosen't work they look the same as before. But they are comfortable I also like the high arch in them. They are pretty when they fist come out of the box but if you are planing on doing any outdoor actives I wouldn't recommend them
B000CFERYS:so_far,_not_so_good_***_see_update_***:cindy_wang	2.0	I received my new shoes this afternoon and took a test run. I didn't really buy this a3 for its "functionality" but rather the look. I thought the honey comb and the color combination look kinda cool. However, I DID NOT at all feel being "propelled through every foot", and the so called a3 cushion heels felt very stiff. I even poked it with my hand, oh man it's hard. I also tried jumping up and down to try to feel the bounciness, but all I did feel was my feet stomping hard onto the cement. 
BTW, if your feet are wide and flat like mine, it's going to be very uncomfortable when walking with these shoes.  

*** UPdate *** November 15, 2006
It's been 2 months since I've been wearing these shoes, and I've changed my opinion them. Once you get use to the a3 sequence, they are actually quite comfortable. The honeycombs under the heels do make every step a little bouncier now. Maybe it takes time to soften up the material and make them more flexible
B0002OQGAC:lovely,_but_poor_color_quality:l._m.	2.0	These were a gift at Christmas, and were a deep burgundy color. they do appear to be well stitched. however, after no more than 2 hand washings in cold water the color showed alot of fading, and by the 3rd wash I knew they would have to be returned as the color fading was uneven and the tops adn bottoms almost don't look like a match anymore.  the silk is soft and lovely but the color should NOT fade this fast or this much!
B0002OQGAC:i_wont_do_it_again:james_d._vantassel	1.0	I was unable to return the item because of restrictions imposed by their return policy

I made a mistake by buying i
B0000A8YAA:mixed_reviews:citymoose	2.0	While the suit fits and looks great, my wife had a problem with the fact that the manufacturer placed a label on the outside of the suit.  It's really the placement that bothered her.  There is a black tag sewn into the middle of the rear seam, which from a distance, looks like one had an accident in their trunks.

Thanks, but no thanks.  These shorts are being returned
B0006TOZZG:players_nylon_boxers:mike	1.0	These are made of a nice material and good for travelling.  However, the inseam is so short that they make no real sense in wearing.  As soon as I sit, nothing is really being covered.

With a longer inseam, these would be awesome
B000GZ6VIE:very_bad:u._chitnis	1.0	Extremely poor quality cloth. Very bad color. It looks used .
Never ever buy any items from this vendo
B000GZ6VIE:strange_sizes_and_poor_quality:alexandra_morrissey_"missingdavid"	2.0	pants were strangely short and bodysuit extra long. also there was a tear in the sleeve of the bodysuit. the quality of the fabric is poor. it served my short term purpose, but i wouldn't purchase this same product again.
B000H8BGO4:took_a_chance_cause_they_were_cheap..:2sleepy	1.0	I ordered a pair for my husband and was very disappointed, the 11 medium that I received was probably as wide as any EEE width I have seen, and whats worse -these just sort of look cheap.  I returned them, and I will avoid buying this brand agai
B000J4N4FK:sorry!_it_broke_right_away!:j._kennedy	1.0	I bought this as a gift and my friend has informed me that after two weeks of use, a pocket ripped so we will be returning it
B0000AWHAL:denim_bib_overalls:paul_e._weser	2.0	Sizes run small. Zipper is short and so are the over the shoulder straps which does not allow for much adjustment. I should have spent a couple bucks more and got Dickies or another brand
B000IDBYLS:sleeves_too_long:zonny's_dad	2.0	The sleeves on this fleece are very long.  I have a 34" sleeve and a medium nearly covered my entire hands.  Not practical if you want to play any sports with this fleece.  I returned mine
B00062WT2E:absolutely_horrible_!:william_t._rumble	1.0	I've been buying these t-shirts for 20 years without issues.  About 9 months ago, Calvin Klein changed the manufacturer.  These t-shirts are nothing but crap now!  They are short and wide instead of the generous cut they used to be, and they came out of the wash after one washing looking like a wet tissue with loose threads.  The price hasn't gone down.. just the quality.  Please don't get ripped off... do NOT buy these shirts.  Here is another case of American immorality at it's best.  Let's cheapen the product so my pocket gets bigger at the expense of yours
B0007Q3U1I:they_hurt_your_feet:c._graves	1.0	I got two pairs of these for my kids and they could hardly walk after wearing these.  Unless the bottom of your feet are tough I would not get these
B0002OQCJM:i_want_my_money_back:barbara_b._mcclintock	1.0	These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply
B000B5TWJ4:slip_sliding_away:knitting_fan	2.0	At first glance, you'll think these are great - but the wimpy elastic combined with the slippery fabric makes for panties that are constantly sliding off your butt.
B0006VNOHY:poor_quality_-_worse_support:kevin_wanko	1.0	I love the Bears. It's impossible for any Bears fan to not love Walter Payton. With that love I ordered this jersey and it shipped to me from FansEdge. The shipping and billing was very speedy and with little delay I had the jersey delivered to my doorstep. It went downhill from there.

As soon as I opened the package I noticed that the 'GSH' (George S. Halas) initials had been sewn over and was broken. Very disappointing. I called FansEdge and they were great on the phone and sent me another jersey. While waiting for the replacement jersey I wore the defective one. By the time the replacement jersey came the iron-on stripes on the sleeves started to peel off. I figured it was just a defective jersey and opened the replacement one. It was exactly the same way. So either FansEdge received a batch of jerseys that were of poor quality or Reebok is maximizing their profit margins and overpricing a cheaply made jersey with one of the most incredible athletes ever name on it.

After asking and waiting 2 weeks for FansEdge to check their supply of jerseys to see if they were all like this with no reply...I cancelled my order. I am still waiting for a refund. This has been over a month now.

With the poor support of FansEdge and what appears like a poorly made jersey I cannot recommend anyone getting this. If you absolutely want one I recommend buying from a brick and mortar store.

B000HQMXCU:not_what_i_expected:a._baldassare	2.0	The boots were not what I expected.  The pictures made the books look different then they actually were.  They were exremely wide and the sizing was off.
B000HQMXCU:definatly_not_what_i_thought:allison_v	1.0	Did not fit well AT ALL.  WAY too big around the ankles - every step I took, the boot would start to fall off.  They were the right size, length wise and all, just way too wide above my ankle.  They were about half as tall as they looked in the photo, which was very disappointing.  I sent the boot back at my own expense the same day.  I would definatly recommend finding a boot you like in the store so you can try it on first, then ordering it off of here for cheaper.
B000HU6OPI:cool_shoes:chantal_cravens	2.0	My "tween" daughter loves these Saucony Jazz shoes.
They are comfortable and stylish.
This is her 3rd pair.
I'm glad that I found them online.
They are both old-school and stylish
B00008ID1O:poor_quality:indigo_girl	1.0	I have worn Jockey panties most of my adult life and witnessed the quality slowly deteriorate over time.  The product went from sturdy cotton with strong stitching to less than paper thin cotton with weak stitching.  Two of the pair in the package were so thin that there were already holes in them!  I shudder to think what shape the panties will be in after a few washings.  Given the cost of panties and other similar products, you'd think the quality would be decent.  However, Jockey isn't the only company out there with a substandard product.  I guess until I can afford to spend substantially more for panties, I'm stuck.  I will only pay sale prices
B00030B3Q2:low_quality_and_fit_too_tight:early_adopter_tx_"early_adopter_tx"	1.0	Looks great on the web, don't think many would buy it if they could examine it in-person.  

Shame, colors and style are excellent just let down in quality and fit
B00009AK9M:pads_fall_out:michelle_firnstahl_"michelle"	1.0	The pads inside the bra fall out every time you wash it.
B00027EV1A:very_disappointed._:joelsindc	1.0	saw these on sale at Macys, on the rack, no box. figured why not, they felt good. But when I tried them on at home the girlfriend started to laugh quite hard. she said I looked like penguin butt and I have a waddle.  I'm going back to other boxer briefs. Personally I didn't find them comfortable at all, and I like this style, A&F;, DKNY, CK, other jockey....i'll stick to those..
B0002PDPEG:this_product_is_typical_in_that_it_has_a_tight_waist_band.:robert_g._reoch	1.0	I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.
B0007WJ1Q0:thin_yoga_strap:nancy_johns_mohlere_"nancy_j._mohlere"	2.0	This strap is thinner than those used in yoga classes.  It is sharp on the arch when held there for poses.  I would not purchase another one.
B000A2475M:product_poor_/_seller_great:william_walsh	1.0	Within two hours of recieving my complaint the seller refunded my money, without requriing that I ship the product back.  For that I am thankful and appreciative, and can recommend the seller. I have no idea what was up with the product.

As I noted earlier, I just recieved this product and it has the overwhelming smell of petroleum, literally like the smell that comes from an oil truck delivering fuel oil to your home.  I bought this for a child and would never dream of giving it to them.  I am contacting the seller to request a refund.  If I succeed I will note that in the review and increase the star rating
B000I32C00:cute_but_uncomfortable:m._saddler	1.0	Cute shoes, but extremely uncomfortable.  I am not sure that I will get much wear out of these shoes.  I know my size but I starting to think they sent me the wrong pair.  I am so frustrated with Amazon where shoes are concerned. This is the 3rd pair of shoes I have bought that does not give me a good fit.  I suggest that you buy a 1/2 size larger than you normally wear but you will then probably run the risk of the shoe later becoming too big, it's a catch 22
B000GF2KIO:it_didn't_work!!!!!:revival_student	1.0	I was impressed by the look of this bag.  It really looked like it would seal the contents well.  Unfortunately, it did not.  I tried several times, and each time, the contents of the bag were soaked!
Fortunately I tested it out with just some cash for a day at the pool... and only ended up with soggy money.  If I had put my cell phone and watch in the bag, they would have been ruined.
I DON'T RECOMMEND IT
B000BK2DSG:nice_"looking"_gloves:n._titan	2.0	These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize.
B00067IF22:ridiculous_sizing:e._waller	1.0	I got these for my son before he arrived in the 0-3 mos size (blue).  They weren't even blue, they were purple.  And, they were so big they fit my 14 mo old, but the arms were too short for her to wear them either!  What a waste of money
B00020O9DC:you_can_buy_the_same_for_less,_or_do_better_with_my_suggestions:lotteryman43	2.0	I was astonished at how flimsy the poncho turned out to be. I mean, at almost $25 invested included shipping, I was expecting better quality. 

Well, it's very thin, made in China, and has plastic snaps. The so-called polyester lining just adds to the heat that's generated. I've owned many ponchos through the years, and the first thing you learn is that a poncho is a terrible design to keep out the elements for more than a short period. The reason involves the way it's cut. What I've learned is that you should buy something with some weight to the fabric so that the wind doesn't lift it up or out and allow the elements inside.

Next, you become hot and start sweating profusely in short time. So, a good lining, or a breathable system is required.

If you're just going to use it for short bursts in the rain, then you can get a cheap $10 nylon or plastic poncho almost anywhere. However, if you camp a lot, or will be out in the elements, you need better. The best poncho I ever owned had a rubberized outer layer and a thin cotton liner. This solves both of the problems I mentioned, because it had the weight to stay down and had the lining to help evaporate the sweat
B000MCAJCA:never_received_it_!!!!:rosa_daneshvar_"rosa"	1.0	I wish there were 0 star. Although these sandals are very beautiful but never ever even try to buy them.
After searching a lot for buying a present for my sister's birthday, I found this sandal and I decided to buy. I ordered it on March 9th and after 20 days !! , still I haven't received them !!!!!! I am getting my money back. 
Not only I have wasted my time but also I should rush to find something as a present which is by the way toooooooooooooo late!!!!
Conclusion: These sandals are very beautiful but NEVER fall for them.
B000ID71LA:plastic_prada_bag:__plastic_=_cheap:kelly_m._telford_"coach_queen"	1.0	I actually sent this bag back immediatley after opening!  I knew it was going to be plastic which was fine with me.  I could use it in the summer at the beach or by the pool.  But, the description said it was trimmed in geniune "pig skin" leather.  When I recieved the bag there was no leather to be found on the bag.  The trim was some type of weird plastic aswell.  It was the cheapest and most fake looking bag I have ever seen!  I couldn't believe that Amazon was selling this product for $200!  I love Amazon and everything they have to offer!  They really shouldn't put there name behind this product anymore.  Any faithful Amazon custom would be shocked and appauled to recieve this on there front step!  I know I was!!!
B000KR2L0K:what_happened_to_my_order?:l._garvin_"l.g."	1.0	I don't recommend you make purchases here. I spent $61 on these items and have only recieved two. There has been no explanation as to what happened to the rest of my order, or my money. Patiently I've waited for over a month for my items to arrive and nothing
B0002TV29M:socks:nancy_copeland	1.0	Not as expected, too short,   nothing special for the price - took forever to receive ( about 3 weeks
B00008ICZ0:no_i_still_got_a_pantyline:stacy	1.0	I still got a pantyline with this---strange and frustrating----
:
B000EHL7V0:i_have_a_question:nancy_r._cowan_"nancy_reader"	1.0	On the advertisement, these sandals were shown in green.  If they were available in green, I would be interested.  Please advise.  Thank
B000EZYXL8:no_strap,_too_tight:artist's_guild_"the_art_student"	1.0	Poor product.  No strap comes with this case.  Too difficult to get the iPod out for updates, whilst trying to pull out iPod can be dropped.  Front view cover is smeary and scratched.  Buttons are difficult to re-snap.  No need for other voting on this --just a poor product
B0002IBRB6:not_for_small_people:l._rustemeyer	1.0	The fanny pack looks nice but the belt did not adjust to be small enough for my hips.  I am a 5'6" 120 lb. small boned female.  The company offered to exchange it, however did not offer any others with cell phone holder.  Now I will have to pay return shipping plus 4.95 restocking fee to return this item.  I did not see the information to learn of this fee before my purchase and am not happy to learn it now
B000790YG4:very_comfortable,_but_very_light_for_a_work_boot.:ronald_l._russell	2.0	This is a classic style work boot which used to be a lot more common than now, even appearing in one episode of "Leave It To Beaver" in the late '50s, and on the cover of one of Simon and Garfunkles albums of the late '60s. I've owned several pair of similar boots by other makers, including Red Wing. Some comments which apply to this style in general, (and not just Wolverines): Pros - The wedge sole absorbs a lot of shock making them great for standing/working on concrete, or walking long distances on hard surfaces. Also, the non-agressive tread means that dirt and grass doesn't track into the house after doing chores outside. The moc toe tends to breath through the seams, so feet tend to stay cooler and drier in hot, dry conditions. A great boot for the desert, and apparantly highly esteemed by many construction workers. 
Cons - The wedge sole doesn't offer much traction for serious hiking on steep, loose surfaces (which I've used them for, but for which they really weren't intended). Gravel will roll right out from under them. None of the several brands I have owned were water-resistant at all. Walking through wet grass will lead to wet socks very quickly, as the seams around the toe which allow air and perspiration to escape also allow outside moisture to enter just as easily. We used to say "Your feet get wet two days BEFORE it rains". So, perhaps not the best choice for hiking in the Pacific Northwest.
Specifically, the Wolverines were extemely comfortable right out of the box. They have a better insole than any of my previous boots of this style, a removeable polyurethane contoured cushion which provides good arch support. The color was actually more of a brown clay, rather than what I would call tan. The quality of workmanship appeared to be pretty good, actually better looking stitching than my Red Wings. However I was disappointed in the variable nature of the leather. The leather in most of the boot appeared to be adequately thick, however the leather used in the shaft around the ankles was thinner than I have ever seen in any work boot, thinner even than in many suede sneakers. While my ankles were covered, they didn't feel at all supported or protected.
After considering for a couple of days, I decided to return the boots to the merchant who provided them for Amazon, The Sportsmans Guide. They had provided a return shipping label in the box, so I taped the box closed, applied the label, and took it to the Post Office. I received an email a few days later acknowledging their receipt of the package, and a notice of a credit applied to my account.
So, while I'm not very excited about the particular pair of boots which I received, I do give good marks to Sportsmans Guide for a quick and relatively painless return. 
 I ended up purchasing the Georgia SPR 6" Farm and Ranch boot, with wedge sole, also available through Amazon. For further details, please see my review
B000AQXC18:heavy_weight?:p._lorenzo_"koolfellow"	2.0	I was mislead by the advertisement. The shorts are skin thin and don't have pockets in them. Quality it is ok for what they really are ... pijama shorts.
Maybe it is my problem 'cause I am not a native English language speaker, maybe not
B000FXUSKY:cheap..._not_worth_it:r._golden	2.0	The plastic screen on this case was very hard to keep clean, and very easy to scratch, so the view quality was horrible.  Also, the case was WAY to tight and was difficult to get the 30GB Video iPod in and out
B000FXUSKY:the_worst_ever:rashidah_hardwick_"shopaholic"	1.0	I had to send this item back twice and still havenot recieved the correct product never order anything from Best Price Center, the owner denied being the correct contact after I spoke with him multiple times at the same number.
B000LX3P76:"out_of_ear"_ear_buds:c._plummer	1.0	I purchased these ear buds to replace those that came with my 80gb ipod expecting them to at least be comfortable.  I can't judge if they are more comfortable or not because they won't stay in my ears long enough to decide.  Even when I'm sitting still on the sofa, they fall out...none of the sizes work for me!!!  If falling out of my ear isn't bad enough, the sound is not even half as good as that produced by the stock ear buds.  Very disappointed!
B0007OES3E:oops:buttercup	2.0	I Purchased this to replace my husband's favorite keyfob from American Eagle, which was almost identical (and lasted ten years, incidentally). This one fell apart after two months. Time for a trip to the local leathersmith..
B000E4UMWI:fingers_too_short!:karen_l._colaiaco	2.0	These gloves are very soft and seem to be made well, but they have a big flaw:  the fingers are too short.  Ordering up a size may not solve any fit problems
B000FELLPE:comfy_silppers:p._a._reinhardt	1.0	These slippers are typical of Daniel Green products, beautiful, comfortable and affordable.
Thank
B0007OW84K:hole_in_pocket:roy_r._james	1.0	Hole in pocket, not completly sewn.
Charcol heather shrank 2 sizes.
Blue shirt pocket was placed almost under the sleeve
B000I30CJ8:ligtning_double_strap_sneaker_review:shirley_a._rozsypal_"s._rosie"	1.0	We could not use these shoes.  The tongues on these shoes are too short and we had to force them on. They were even a 1/2 size larger than our grandson wore.  It was a big disappointment and waste of money.  Save your receit
B0007IN3EU:not_true_to_size:l._pascal_"shoe_lover"	2.0	I bought this pair of shoes because the look really good but the shoe doesnot run true to size, I bought an 11.5m and had to return it because my instep could not enter the shoe. Be very caefull when buying I suggest buying half a 1 size bigger than your average size
B000I5N5OK:not_enough_colors:adolph	2.0	The scarves were good quality but I should have paid more attention to previous reviewers on this gift.
the pack had about 5 or 6 black scarves and a couple other colors, nothing like the picture. save your dough on these scarves
B000I5N5OK:never_received_the_merchandise._:fl_"fl"	1.0	I never received this order and they have not responded to emails regarding order status. This left me without gifts for co workers over the holidays ...I am out the money
B000I5N5OK:6_blacks,_4_reds:renata_z	1.0	Extremely dissapointed in the colors I received.  Out of 10, 6 were black, 3 red (2 shades), 1 pink.  I could deal with 6 blacks and 4 different (and I mean different - not all red-toned) colors, but not with what I got.  Useless.

I'm upset beyond words.  Will never buy from this seller again, and will not recommend to anyone I know, unless the seller comes through and fixes this
B0009EWKD2:no_laces?!?!?_:maggie_pulido_"mancham"	2.0	I COULDN'T BELIEVE IT!! MY SON OPENED THE BOX OF SHOES TO FIND THE SHOES CAME WITH NO LACES!! HE WAS SO UPSET THAT HE WASN'T ABLE TO WEAR THEM RIGHT AWAY, BECAUSE IT WAS DEC. 24 EVERYTHING WAS ALREADY CLOSED AND NOTHING WOULD BE OPEN UNTIL DEC. 26, AND WHY SHOULD WE HAVE TO PAY FOR SHOE LACES??? I'M GLAD YOU SENT ME THE E MAIL, BECAUSE I'D LIKE TO SEND THE SHOES BACK!! WE WERE ABLE TO FIND A BRAND NEW PAIR (WITH LACES) AT A BETTER PRICE.
B000EBC4PY:get_what_you_pay_for:t._morgan	2.0	I had been looking for fingerless gloves to wear while I type-- they keep the office I work at at very cold temperatures.  These gloves seeemed perfect--because many fingerless gloves- don't have fingerless thumbs--but these gloves do.  The cost was only 2.99 for a pair of black or navy gloves.  I ordered the black pair.  Well, the knit gloves began to fray on the first wearing- there are many stray strands at the fingers-- they snag easily.  They are warm and I would love them if they did not snag and fray so easily.  But I did only pay 2.99 for them so I guess it's a case of you get what you pay for.
B000BPZ2LQ:he_unleashed_his_provocative_side...:malfouka_"malfouka"	1.0	..all over the neighbourhood.  now we're getting divorced and it's all YOUR FAULT Male Power Sheer Bong Thong!  i hate you
B000FMZWY2:shapeless_leggings:kate	1.0	Really uncomfortable. I wore them twice and then threw them out. They sagged like a sad pair of tights you used to wear when you were little. And they became transparent like they were going to rip at any moment. Not worth the $5 I paid
B000FWALIO:rip_off!:c._chelsea	2.0	This review isn't really about the flip-flops, because theyre great. Why would you buy them here for $5.61 when you can get them at the store for $2.50 each?
B000ANOH5G:3_months_and_no_shirts_sent_yet_and_no_refund!:c._clinic_"earlesummers2003"	1.0	I ordered these White Tank Tops and 3 colored Tank Tops.  I have never received these White Tank Tops and have requested a refund and requested another size they had in stock and have received neither.  I have sent emails requesting this and still no resolve
B0007OQ8M8:boohoo:e._little_"nodress4me"	1.0	I bought this dress for a trip I'm taking in one week. Should've known better. You get what you pay for, that's for sure. This dress arrived balled up in a USPS bag. It didn't look anything like the picture shown on this site, more like a slip, than a slip dress. And here's the kicker - it was RIPPED! Had two large "snags" on the back of the dress. I'm sending it back and they BETTER not try to charge me shipping. I'm PO'd to the max and who knows if I'll find a dress in time. Grrrr
B000E8O9A0:negative:trisha_h._brown	1.0	I bought 2 sleepers.  sleeper had holes in the arm pit area and the other sleeper had a whole where the neck trim should of been sewed on. A real waste of my money
B000ML1XJE:cute_but...:nicole_d._bryant_"wedding_guru"	2.0	These shoes are cute but 1) They are made wide 2) the heel is a little bigger than 2" 3) They are uncomfortable to walk in. I think I could find a better pair at Wal-mart if I had to.

The company charged me tax on their shipping charges so they get a BIG TWO THUMBS DOWN for that
B000ML1XJE:item_returned:linda_k._brown_"phatmeat"	1.0	I had to return this item because the shoes where too big but other than that everything else was ok with the products I received
B000J157EE:uggs-ugh!:lori_l._antecki	1.0	These boots were the worst ever!  They were grossly missized and not as depicted.  The back of the boot had a tape with embroidery up it that was mysteriously not pictured when ordering. When returned, the company refused to reimburse shipping even though they acknowledged that this was deceiving. Never again
B000BPUHIO:poorly_made:goldilocks_"katie"	2.0	These gloves are a little itchy - the profile states that they are fully lined, however the insulation does not extend to the finger openings so you have wool around each finger...some people don't mind the feeling-- personally it drives me nutty.  It's a present, however, so we'll see how he feels about the material.  My main gripe, however, is that the stitchiing is incredibly poor.  Right out of the package, the velcro stiching is coming loose and the velcro is starting to pull up.  The black stiching connecting the leather pads to the glove part is laughable.  It's an "overstich" and most of them look like they'll start to loosen at anytime, causing the leather pad to come off.  There are different colored threads poking out through seams as well.  
  They DO look nice from afar and seem warm (I only tried them on quickly), but for the price...yikes
B000EIXDXY:keds_kate_stain_rest._sneakers:sherry_j._townzen	1.0	Shipping was quick.  The shoes are comfortable and stay clean longer.  When soiled they clean up well.  Some wide widths are good but these give just a little more room than most.  The little extra width was more than welcome when on a recent trip I was doing alot of walking & the feet were really swollen. I am pleased with the shoes so far.
B000CJDIDA:please_help_i_never_receive_my_stuff:julio_carrillo_"julces13"	1.0	I never receive this ITEM, i want may money back or replace my order
B0009YJFZ8:dont_like:alphamom_"alphamom"	2.0	The sleeves are long and the shirt is short. I dont know about others but that is NOT how I like my clothes.... Wont look to good with low rise jeans! At least not with my average body. I dont weight 95 pounds
B000H0RYAW:these_are_not_leather_as_stated_in_the_description...:h._pulley	2.0	These boots are very cute and comfortable. However they are NOT leather as stated in the description. They are clearly labeled ALL MANMADE MATERIALS on the inside of the boot. Since they are now marked down so low they are a good deal, but the price I paid is not worth it for non-leather boots
B000AP4ZZG:dissatisfied:mary_g._mccall	1.0	This order was most unsatisfactory. I received the shoes with the security device attached. I had to take the time and trouble to send them back to have the devices detached. I have yet to receive them. I would advise customers to avoid orders
B00078XPVQ:afraid_for_buyers:vicki_m._wagner	1.0	I purchased what I thought were "deals" from 2 seperate vendors and was very disappointed. 

To get a pair of decent fitting sweats, you have to pay the price, and you won't regret it.

I hope this advice helps
B0000B38MZ:terrible-out_of_stock_but_didn't_say_for_days,_then_too_late:orlando	1.0	and no customer service on weekends at even before xmas
B00008DGX1:more_comfort_elsewhere:d.c.80	2.0	I bought a pair of these Calvin Klein hip briefs at a local retail store last year. I found this pair of underwear to be very tight and uncomfortable. I'm large up front and I found the crotch area to be quite small and thin. The pouch is also to small. I am a briefs man myself, but these are not as comfortable as most briefs. I can say though these briefs are good for wearing under low rise jeans. I would rather wear the Calvin Klein trunks or a pair of boxerbriefs instead of the hip briefs. The trunks are more comfortable for well endowed guys like me. If I had to choose only between these underwears or none at all, I would rather not wear any underwear at all
B000145UKA:started_off_great:j._barnett_"jenny@designaweb.com"	2.0	I loved this bra when I first got it a year ago.  It gave me great support, it looked great and I was the happiest with a bra that I have ever been.  My girls are in the F range so it has been difficult to find the right size.  A year later, the girls are headed south and the bra has no support left in it.  I am really disappointed in the quality after paying almost $70 for one bra.  They are on a great product if it could stand the longevity of time.  One year just doesn't work for me.
B000145UKA:great_comfort_-_poor_quality:trisha_a._nonte	1.0	I absolutely loved this bra when I first put it on, but after only a couple of washings the metal underwire broke through the fabric and started poking at my underarm.  I thought it was just a rare occurence, but I bought a couple more of these bras and the same thing happened everytime.  They cost way too much money to only get two or three wears out of them.  I am so disappointed in the quality of the underwire
B0002OQCJ2:nice_material,_but_that's_about_it._:info	2.0	I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it
B0009K5UJW:pretty_but_not_very_comfortable:w._bills	2.0	This bra works okay but the material is really uncomortable.  The lace cups isn't feel like flour sack material.
B000KBLALC:save_your_money!!:m._haynes_"recoton1"	1.0	This is a disgraceful garment. I am not kidding when I say that the "sweater" is less than 1 MM thick. The best description that I could give you is tracing paper. It is virtually see-through. When I put it on for the first time, all of the tags ripped off as it is poorly constructed. There is also an obnoxious "Z" on the left chest area. Very tacky. This will be in the very back of my closet until I get around to donating it or throwing it away. Miserable, Miserable purchase.
B000GZYJL0:lasted_exactly_one_winter:daniel_smith_"daniel"	2.0	They are warm and comfortable while they last.


All of the sheep skin inside has fallen out, there is a hole where my big toe is inside the slipper.  The outside of the slipper still looks like new.


It is sort of depressing they only lasted 3-4 months
B000GZYJL0:quality_control:steven_c._gerhartz	1.0	I bought these based on a previous review. After wearing them for 3 days the stitching on one came apart. Maybe the quality control person was out that day??? I returned them and got a full refund
B000GZYJL0:if_you_pay_for_cheap_slippers_that's_what_you_get:jason_f._ruimerman	1.0	Not Happy at all with these slippers.  Do not buy them.  They lasted 3-4 week and then he inside was shot.
B000GZYJL0:would_you_like_to_know_what_it_feels_like_to_have_your_feet_in_a_vise?:darel_l._dillingham_"dd53"	1.0	These slippers are without a doubt the most uncomfortable things I've ever put my feet into. The concept is good, but the shearling lining is so thick that you would definately want to order the next size larger. That might solve the length discomfort, but there still isn't sufficient heighth comfort. They felt like an all encompassing vise, squeezing my feet so tightly that I had to remove them to gain relief. Very uncomfortable.
B00007282M:good_shoes_bad_expedited_delivery:miguel_angel_gonzalez_hurtado	2.0	those are a good shoes, but the delivery provide service is the worst, i buy the shoes dic 15-06 in expedite service 1-3 days and i recive the shoes 21  4 days more than usually delivery day, i pay 12 more dollars for expedite and theirs give it to me like regular mail, bad deal to me
B000I2XBPQ:didn't_last_long:j._offer	2.0	I bought these at Target for my sons.  My six year old wore his two months until they fell apart.  Not too long in my opinion.
B000KA8O9Y:hard_to_balance_in:celeste_gomez	1.0	very cute but have a funky balance, wobly and on the verge
of falling over. not comftorable. poorly designe
B000KA8O9Y:cute_boots,_but_ouch:goddessxena	2.0	Really cute boots, but the back zipper made my heels feel as if they weren't supported, and about to slide out.  The 4" heels force your feet into a near ballerina toe pose and I had to take these off after half a day.  My next step is to try some insoles for them and maybe that will help
B000FCO7F2:so-so:debbie_o	2.0	I had this bag on my wishlist and got it for Christmas.  I wanted it for when I take daytrips to the beach.  I am really disappointed with the size.  It's pretty deep, but not very wide at all.  No way I'll be able to take everything I need to the beach in this bag.  Still, I'll be able to use it for other things
B0002OQCIS:nice_material,_but_that's_about_it._:info	2.0	I had got these for my husband for christmas. Nice material, however they were too tapered at the ankle and also short for him and he is average height, so we had to return it
B0002OQCIS:i_want_my_money_back:barbara_b._mcclintock	1.0	These pants were washed one time, following the washing instructions, they were not put in the dryer, and they shrunk not only around, but lengthwise.  I had purchased these same pants a year or so ago and didn't have any problems.  I look forward to your reply
B000I28LGU:not_happy:cornell_j._shelton	2.0	THE COLORS OF BANDANNAS I ORDERED WERE NOT THE COLORS I RECEIVED.  THE INVOICE SENT WITH THE BANDANNAS DID NOT CONFIRM  THE COLORS I ORDERED SO I DID NOT HAVE PROFF THAT SEVERAL ERRORS WERE MADE, BUT I KNOW WHAT I ORDERED.  I WAS CONCERNED AFTER PLACING THE ORDER BECAUSE THE COLORS WERE NOT STATED ON THE CHECKOUT PAGE, BUT SINCE I HAD ORDERED THEM BEFORE, I THOUGHT THERE WOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM
B000I28LGU:incomplete_order:vikettescoach	2.0	I ordered 16 bandanas at the last minute for my dance team's competition, but I only received 12 in the mail.  The packing slip said 16 and I was charged for the 16.  It was too late for me to order more and the color was too rare for me to find in the stores.  Would have given only 1 star but at least they sent it to me on time.
B0006M4L34:demagnetizer:tony_lodge_sims	2.0	I purchased the DOPP Money Clip and Card Holder for a specific  Vacation Cruise.  It is nicely constructed but two negatives were exposed: One, It will only hold about six bills and Two, it demagnetized my room Key Card twice over eight days. Realizing this could also demagnetize my regular Credit Cards, I removed them from the Card Holder. I am reluctant to use the Money Clip again.
B000G67PU6:really_regretting_the_purchase.:daniela_letz	1.0	Even though I favor leather, every once in a while a pleather product comes along that I really appreciate. Well, these boots sadly are not in that category. The pleather started cracking after I wore the boots x3; the lining was poorly cut to begin with and started unraveling. The sad part is that for the amount of money that I spend on these boots, I could have bought a pair of leather ones after x-mas
B000FW5UJE:giants_wear_this_jacket.:pinxi	2.0	I am solidly a size medium, but I was swimming in this jacket.  I think it is more of an XL.  I'd say the medium is for someone 5'10" and 250lbs
B000FL00E0:lousy_design:anonymous	1.0	There was no picture of this selection, so I guessed it was a "ringer" type t-shirt.  Instead it was a white shirt with ugly red contrast stitching.  I never wore it, but gave it to Goodwill
B0006VN9DS:never_recevied_dress:kh_"kh"	1.0	I ordered this Dress on March 6th. I recevied an email from the company saying that it would ship by March 8th. On March 16th, I receive an email saying that they are out the size I wanted and my order has been canceled. This is unacceptable from a business. I should have been notified by March 9th that the dress had not been shipped. I have less than 24 hours to find a replacement dress. Thanks alot
B000EE54TY:don't_bother:j._fox	1.0	I was very dissappointed by this item.  It arrived folded into a 6X6 square bag and was very creased when opened.   It will take considerable pressing to try and get it out.  The fabric is too stiff and doesn't drap well. The length isn't long enough to drape over your shoulders and wear as a wrap.  The return policy makes this purchase not worth the risk
B000GEPASC:lacks_quality_control:c._aristy	1.0	Very nice prints, but the quality of the briefs is not good. To top it, one of the briefs was even damaged. I guess the maker doesn't have a quality control department. Overall, a bad buy.
B000NA4HKG:horrible_fitting:a._yimsiriwattana_"digitalkitty"	1.0	Beware, the size is not true size fit
My small turn out to be something that fits like a LARGE from some other brands.
this is not a small, it's loose fitting and it's a straight line cut. it's really BAD.it's so disappointing.
everything doesnt holds in places, it doesnt look like the photo at all.
the materials is nice but the fittting is beyond horrid.
Dont buy this dress unless you are really curvy, and if you are a medium, you need a SMALL for this dress, and it will still fit loosly on you. that's how big of a dress this is.
I'm returning it
B000E3FKMQ:cinderella's_ugly_sister:jason_t._clydesdale_"bedpan3"	2.0	size 9.5 fit like it was an 8. I wear a 9 typically and could barely get my foot in, and was unable to walk in them at all without pain. I've bought Steve Madden before many times and know they run slightly small, but this pair was ridiculously small and I suspect perhaps mis-labeled
B000E3FKMQ:cute_but_uncomfortable_and_size_runs_small:marcene	2.0	I only gave the shoes 2 stars because they are cute.  Other than that they were quite unusable.  I usually wear a size 7 but I could not even get my foot into these shoes...and they are quite hard.  Had to get rid of them
B000E3FKMQ:cute_but_not_comfortable!:i._white_"godzzgal"	2.0	I acutally saw this shoe on a young lady who matched them so well with her outfit.  I even complimented her on them.  I liked so much how they looked on her that I took the time to locate them online (Amazon).  I ordered them with much anticipation that I would also look cute in them.  Needless to say, looks ARE deceiving.  Perhaps, they felt better on her than they did on me but I felt like I was squeezing my feet into a pair of hard plastic.  I was disappointed.  If there's nothing I've learned being a woman in her mid-30s, I come to realize that there's nothing like a cute but comfortable pair of shoes..
B000M10MS2:whatever...:nicole_d._bryant_"wedding_guru"	1.0	These shoes are not as cute as they appear, the heel is really 2.5", the material is cheap, the fit is too wide, the shoes are uncomfortable to walk in, etc. etc. etc.

On a positive note, it's the type of shoes that can be worn with a pair of jeans or a cocktail dress. 

Be warned, the company claims that all their shoes have 2" heels when they don't and they charge tax on shipping charges..
B0002VG2XG:not_what_i_expected:heather_love_"princess_random"	2.0	The footbed on these clogs is very comfortable, but buyer beware - the buckles are attached with staples through the suede and come undone very easily (in my case, after two wearings) The seller's return policy is such that once the shoes have been worn outside, they won't take them back.  I had to sew the buckles back on.  In my opinion, $100 shoes shouldn't need to be repaired after two wearings.  

The suede is also much darker than the picture - still a pleasant color, but not what I expected when I ordered
B0002VG2XG:poor_after_3_months_college_campus_wear:p._l._anderson_"plapta"	1.0	my daughter bought these herself, because she couldn't afford the real birky's.  she bought them in august 2006, now november 18, 2006 the soles are worn out and the buckle just broke yeaterday. wasted pair of shoes.  anyone have any ideas for good affordable shoes similar to birkys??

B0007LXLLW:much_smaller_then_i_expected:timothy_j._haas	2.0	This bag is much smaller then i was expecting. the zippers do not open/shut easily.  I was very disapointed
B000BOK0KU:ann_klein_good_shoes...but_not_this_one:j._sumpter	2.0	I have purchased AK in the past but this is the first time i was disappointed. The shoe felt cheap to me and not very sturdy. I would not recommend this shoe to anyone
B000CCZU42:poor_craftmenship:j._connery	2.0	the cap is nice and presumably does what it is suppose to do by keeping my hair out of my face. However, the stitching at the seam at the back of the cap began coming apart from the day that I first used it. It hasnt torn completely...yet. Nevertheless, I would think that putting a skull cap on once with my short hair would cause a tear so sooon. I wouldnt suggest this produc
B000CCZU42:not_what_i_expected.:everett_hall	2.0	Wow, the headband on this skull cap is cutting off my 
circulation!  It is way too tight for casual wear.  Also, 
the fabric on top is almost as thin as panty-hose, and 
your hair will poke through if you have a buzz-cut like me.  

If you're not an athlete, then don't buy this skull cap.  
It's meant primarily for bald football players to wear
under their helmets
B000FTNR5G:size_too_big,_fabric_is_bad:john_zhao	1.0	I ordered 4 of them because they were on sale.  But all of them are at least 2 size bigger than they should be.  In addition, the fabric is bad.  There are tores in all of the edges
B0009ALVNQ:jersey_is_rough_and_uncomfortable:randall_shafer_"sportyclub"	1.0	This is a nicly styled jersey that could use a fabric or fabric finish makeover. The plain polyester is rough to the skin requiring the use of an undershirt to prevent chafing. The collar is cut high enough to cut across the base of the neck leaving a nasty burn mark.

A cotton, cotton blend, or silk would have made a better choice of fabric making this an unbeatable jersey for many uses
B000ETMBLI:not_worth_it!:s._nestoss	1.0	This bra has an akward fit.  I had to return it.  A better bra for low cut clothes would be the clear strap bra from victoria's secret
B0009DNSD4:by_far_the_most_painful_shoes_i've_ever_worn.:girliegurl	1.0	I bought these shoes and wore them to my first fitting.  By the end of my fitting, my feet were throbbing, red, and pinched.  Literally, my pinky toe was purple.  

I bought my true size, but I still don't think these shoes would've been wearable even with a size larger.  They must just be REALLY narrow
B000085HYH:this_item_was_everything_i_didn't_want._:d._hawley	1.0	The advertising of this product on your site is kind of deceiving, because it doesn't properly show it. From what I saw on the Amazon site, I thought the wallet will be much bigger.  Amazon doesn't give measurements of the product, and there are not enough pictures of the it. Basicly it isn't worth it to buy a product if I'm not sure of how it looks like.  Now I have a wallet that my husband does not want, and I can do nothing with it.  I feel that I wasted $25.00
B00030AZL6:doesn't_fit:j._gould_"south_paw712"	2.0	Cute designs but they shrink.  I have to stretch the sheet back out after washing it and when I attempt to put it on the mattress it flips up.
B00008O0RV:not_great:m._ripplinger_"bee_girl"	2.0	I am a 44DD I am having the hardest time finding a good bra...I ordered this one and I am a little dissapointed.  The underwires in the front poke out and make it look like I have these bones sticking straight out of my chest.  Everthing else is ok...no complaints other than the underwire not laying flush with my chest bone
B000MVFFZC:tear-away_pants:rigortmortis	1.0	Ordered gray, they shipped black. Since it is from Canada i'm not even going to waste return shipping charges. Minor inconvenience, yet still folks, I ordered Gray! Pants are also NOT new, the tags are ripped and torn, it looks like return or wholesale merchandise. I feel cheated, angry, but mostly just disappointed. For shame people, for....shame....
B000NTCHTA:babydoll_top:monica_mock_lam	1.0	Need to use a belt definitively. Does not look like the picture. If you do not use a belt, you will seem like wearing a pijama instead of a top.
B0007L8CFC:not_like_the_picture!:pooya_eslami	2.0	The color is very pale and not very much not as vivid as the picture. Also, from the picture you think that it is high quality and fine threaded but the threads are large and not so apealing as the picture shows. Good customer support though I couldn't return it because of being a gift
B0009C9BUY:great_looking_shoes,_terrible_quality:donald_n._bernier	1.0	These shoes are very comfortable, look great but I had a terrible problem with the "ruggedness" of these shoes.  I am an avid hiker and climber and bought these shoes for the reasons that Merrill is known for, ruggedness and great outdoor shoes.  After only owning these shoes for a month I noticed that the leather sides were cracking away from the sole.  This happened on both pairs of shoes and soon there was 2 holes in each pair.  The insides ripped from slipping them on and off.  I returned the pair to the store I bought them at and got a new pair.  The same problem happened.  These shoes are very cheap and very expensive.  Do not buy!  They look great but unless you are planning on displaying them only I would stay away from them
B000H40TGY:just_wasn't_what_i_thought!:linda_hyter	1.0	This boot looked so much better online. For this boot to be by Nine West it looked very cheap. I was very disappointed with this product that I returned it but I'm still waiting for my refund!!
B0002Z1HTQ:fair_for_the_price:n._bolson	2.0	These boots look good on the first wear.  I bought the black patent boots and after one, not so wild night, they scuffed and had sveral little tears in the material.  If you need boots for one night, for that perfect outfit, these will suffice.
B000FCSX5C:elastic_is_too_tight...:s._mcclellan	2.0	The elastic in these shoes makes them too uncomfortable to wear. Otherwise, the quality of the lace shoes is good. I'd wear them if the elastic didn't dig into my foot (I have small feet too!)
B000FCSX5C:poor_design:meg	1.0	Poor design and fit, such that after 4-5 wears, the front of both shoes wore out - into a hole.  Not recommended
B000BUY2IA:just_wierd_fit:rainer_powell	1.0	i love the colts, but this sweatshirt is supposed to be a large, it is the wierdest fitting sweatshirt i have efer seen. the shoulders are to big and the neck is to tight. i wear a large but i cant wear this shirt because it looks so awkward
B0000WZQMK:thin:roger_a._hampton_"rattlesnake_21"	2.0	The sweater I received was extremely thin: I had expected something more like an LL Bean cardigan, which I dearly love.  I was wrong.  What do I do now?

B0000UR3GY:pathetic:matt_b	1.0	After six months of little use, the inside heal fell apart on both shoes.  The fabric is made poorly and will cause blisters on your heal once it quickly deteriorates. Do not buy this shoe
B000IAQXZS:not_at_all_happy:william_l._bryant_jr.	1.0	The stockings were not in the package, and there is no good way to get in touch with the company that sold me outfit in the first place. My girlfriend was disappointed and I felt like a fool when no one even took the time to return my call. I will not do business with this company again
B0003SSO8O:ouch_again!:k._schindler	2.0	This product worked well in holding up a strapless bra, but after a few hours, my skin developed a blister underneath the tape. I would rather risk the wardrobe malfunction than have any more blisters, so use this product with caution
B000AY89TU:horrible.:daniel_hong_"daniel_hong"	1.0	Horrible. Must go through hell to return it too, they won't give you back the shipping to send it to you, just the cost of the item. Do not buy. Do not recommend
B000AY89TU:disappointed_:jonathan_weinisch	1.0	i had a good experience with 80s purple last year, so when i needed prop glasses i knew where to look. i got my order, the glasses were scratched and the frames were damaged. i called and they said they would send me a replacement right away, i was quite pleased. it has been over 3 weeks and i have not received them, i have called and emailed them several times with no response. not even picking up the phone. i plan on contesting the charges on my card and will not be shopping here any mor
B000AY89TU:awfull_service:alexander_guts	1.0	Order placed by 7th of July didn't arrived by now.
No sunglasses... No money... No response from the seller...
The most awfull seller I have ever co-operated with....
I wish I would not ordered this nice glasses from this dishonourable seller....
Think twice before placing an order & paying money..
B00028RQ1G:total_dissapointed:c._gonzalez_"venezuelan_customer"	1.0	This is saled as a baseball shoes but it is for american footbal. But the mistake goes more long, because the photo included shows a baseball shoes how you can observ in the marks of the sole
B000A1FJ5K:awful:rebecca_l._pupillo_"bluucantu"	1.0	I could not believe the quality in these shoes...HORRIBLE!
The material feels and sounds like cardboard or paper. They have an awful smell and are uncomfortable. I bought chinese shoes in china town for $2, they were wonderfully comfortable, still smelled funny, but they were awesome.these are not!
B0007LM7K8:don't_buy_the_hairagami:carmela_barrett_"jogger3kids"	1.0	IT IS A HORRIBLE ITEM.  IF I COULD HAVE GIVEN THIS HAIRAGAMI A NO STAR RATING, I WOULD HAVE, AND TO THINK I WASTED ALMOST $20 FOR THIS JUNK. IT SNAPS UNEXPECTEDLY ALL THE TIME, AND ALWAYS WHILE YOU ARE TWIRLING THE HAIR.  IT TOTALLY TANGLES THE HAIR. IT IS A NIGHTMARE TO GET OUT OF YOUR CHILD'S HAIR.
MY OLDEST, 12, REALLY WANTED THIS HAIRAGAMI AND WAS TOTALLY DISAPPOINTED.
SHE TOLD ALL HER FRIENDS NOT TO BUY IT
B000FD8KJU:lightweight:kate_cord	1.0	Material extremely thin and almost transparent when it is held up to light. It's very dissappointing for an Izod product.  I would have returned it had I not bought it for my 82 year old father whom discarded the packaging
B000CATEVE:misleading:morgan_k._ryerson	1.0	The pants are not Juniors', they are Women's pants that go up past your waistline when you wear them
B00070PH6A:a_month_later,_no_delivery:b._theissen	1.0	How lame... 30 days later, no shipment, no delivery.


Very disgusted.

B0007YMYS0:inconsistent_sizing,_cheap_construction:m._johnson	1.0	I realize this isn't an expensive bra, but I expected it to at least FIT! I've never ordered a bra that was sized this crazy! The band was way too big and the cups were way too small. Needless to say I'm returning it. Save your money, ladies!

On top of that, it took almost a month to receive it because it was out of stock. Even though Figleaves displayed the item as IN STOCK. This is the third time Figleaves has done this for Amazon items. I think I'll skip buying from them in the future
B0007TC03Y:review:natalie_g._rossman	1.0	The mask is WAY too tight, either that, or I just have an abnormally big head which I don't think I do.  It should be adjustable, and it's not.  Would not recommend this
B000IVU2GS:get_what_you_pay_for...:g._lewis	2.0	The battery function didn't work. Discovered poor battery wiring inside... I might try troubleshooting it myself with an ammeter and some soldering. I'm not surprised by the crude construction from a $11 item. However, the hand grips themselves are worth the money. No more cramped hands
B000IVU2GS:used?:v._andrews	2.0	We received this product in a clear plastic molded container, however there were no instructions at all, nor was there any label.  We immediately thought, this must not be a new product.  Not knowing exactly how to attach it to the PSP or detach it, one of the clips has broken.  We also have more questions - can the battery inside this charger be replaced? If so, what kind is it?  I think we'll be returning this product
B000KEBHGC:horrible!!_:(:a._lasker_"myob"	1.0	When I got ordered these shoes, I was so excited because the picture looked so nice. Do not be deceived by its looks. I saw it in another store, and I tried it on for fun. The shoe fits poorly, and its actually really ugly. I would definitely not reccomend it to any one
B000CNPGEA:not_a_good_clock:ann_marie	1.0	I bought this for the flashlight feature.  You have to press and hold the button in a clumsy way in order to keep the green flashlight on.  Also, the only way to have the clock light up is if you have the alarm on.  The buttons on the front are cheap and don't seem like they'll last very long
B000HVYPG2:not_what_you_expect:validated_in_seattle	2.0	You have to wear a thick pair of socks in order for the slipper socks to fit  properly.  They only fit properly for one wearing, stretch all out of shape until you wash and dry.  I have fleece socks from llbean which are wonderful and thought I would try these. "You get what you pay for" applies to this product
B000HVYPG2:horrible_socks:shopper_"shopper"	1.0	These socks were thin, large, and horrible.  They had no elastic in them to keep them up and they fell down frequently.  Absolutely worthless
B000AOAOQG:item_received_not_as_shown-_bait_and_switch_!!!:aquarius	2.0	I received the Smart tool Dynamo instead of the Illuminator. Very disappointed because I ordered 5 for Xmas gifts and do not have enough time to reorder.
B000AOAOQG:false_advertisement:l._ricci	1.0	Illuminator is shown in ad, but a generic brand was shipped to me.  The light wasn't as bright and it wasn't made very well.The crank was cheaply made, and the button that you press didn't work every time.
B000GIYBH4:cheesy:j._taliaferro	1.0	I was very surpised at the poor quality of these stockings. I have purchased Leg Avenue before and found them to be excellent, however these were like fifty cent bought off the back of someone's truck brand. As a matter of fact I've bought better fifty cent off the back of the truck stockings!Leg Avenue is now off my list! Of course, if they priced them three for a dollar,now that might be worth the price
B000MRETQ2:capris:elly_slama_"elly"	2.0	This product was disappointing.  Not at all what was expected and sizing was way way different than expected.  I guess they will make a nice gift for my 12 year old niece since that is the type of body that a womens large will fit
B0002TRVJ2:stinky_socks:kathleen_a._kempke_"shoe_horse"	1.0	I wore these once and got a huge hole in the toe.  Should not happen at nearly $6 a pair and a logo of GOLD TOE
B0006GRL8C:false_advertisement:k._calabrese_"lilome24"	1.0	These socks are advertised as seamless toe socks. They are very thin and they DO have a very uncomfortable seam in the toe. Not only does the seam press into the toe, but you can feel the inner seam of the shoe itself. Terrible product
B00065TD2K:not_worth_the_money:l._tufts	1.0	I was very disappointed with this bra.  I would definately not recommend it.  If you are looking for a good and supportive nursing bra try the Maternelle bra instead.

This bra looks sexy, but does not offer the support and coverage needed for a nursing bra (at least not for a size 38DD)
B0006TP032:incorrect_sales_listing:m._pagano	1.0	this listing isen't correct.
item NTS1 is a nylon tank top shirt, not a t-shirt
B000AS81N0:no_cotton:e._boscov	1.0	I bought this bra because the ad says 100% cotton.  There is no cotton in this bra.  It is 86% nylon and 14% elastane.  If you want a cotton bra, this is not for you
B000689D4U:not_street_shoe_size!:kmmom	2.0	Although the description of these booties says they run true to size, they do not! I ordered a full size and a half larger than my daughter's regular shoe size and they were still too small for her to put on her feet. Now I have to pay more shipping for an exchange. Not a great transaction experience
B000ISHM2I:not_good_enough:cleo_patra	1.0	This bag was not what I expected.  The leather was cheap and it wasn't really big enough to fit much.  I would not recommend this bag if you want it to hold a lot of items/paper.
B000BH1LXW:poor_jacket._do_not_buy:p._kothari_"pria"	1.0	I have the same jacket in black but I bought this from elsewhere. What a rip off it is. It is made in china and the feather keeps on coming and on a given day I had to remove atleast 20- 25 of the feathers since they peek so much. I doubt how long this is going to last as eventually it will be a skinny jacket without the feathers.!!! Do not BUY
B000BH1LXW:serious_feather_loss!:meaghean_in_nyc	1.0	This jacket is extremely poorly made.  I have it in black, but I should say black and white, because there is so much white from the feathers peeking through
B000FA7E5E:cheap_:kenneth_j._lehocky_"kenl"	1.0	When I purchased this, I was under the false impression that the idea of a silicon skin was to provide the unit with some shock protection in the event that it were to get dropped. 

The skin is so thin, that it does nothing but keep a little bit of dust off of the buttons.

The belt clip is made of brittle plastic and broke the second day that I used it.

Don't waste your money, spend the extra bucks to get something that will last a while.
B000B8FCEU:i_expected_more...:c._j._wright	1.0	When you buy Natori you expect the best.  But this product just isn't up to their usual high standard.  Most disappointing is the elastic used at the leg and waist openings.  For 20 dollars they should be awesome.  They aren't.

My favorite panty right now is a Nordstrom brand boy short that is really comfortable and costs about 10 bucks.  I haven't seen them online, but this is worth a trip to the store
B000GDMCYI:sized_too_small;_waste_of_money:ltnbrn	1.0	I have found Gerber brand clothing to be disappointing. The don't stand up to laundering very well, in that they shrink quite a bit. They already seem small for the size on the label, but it gets worse after you wash and dry them (even on the "delicate" cycle). My 6-week old was already wearing onesies and sleepers sized 3-6 months! It's worth spending the extra money for a better brand, such as Carter's
B000GY2AIA:very_thin_and_light:chad_baley	1.0	This is an okay jacket. The padding in it is okay. Sizes tend to run a little smaller than normal. There is no liner, and you will get cold riding at night. Overall the jacket has only 2 layers, and if you hold it in front of you you can see through the mesh. Spend a little bit more and get something that will hold up
B000CQOVOI:crocs:christalyn_aitken_"home_schooling_mom"	2.0	I thought I was on the same page as crocs when I ordered the PWClog.  It confusing...I thought I was ordering a sale on Crocs.

They are not Crocs..
B000CQOVOI:shoes:heather_obrien_"heathero"	1.0	i was very disappointed in the shoes i were them to work and within 1 hour then strap on them broke.i love the way they look but not the quality of them.i would take them in every color made if they were worth the money spent on them
B0001HX20M:you_do_not_send_me_this_t-shirt:miguel_angel_leal_ramirez	1.0	Why? I do not know. But be more carefully anbout it
B0001HX20M:not_what_i_thougth_i_ordered:b._mulroy_"d"	1.0	For starters, this shirt is not a lighter, royal blue like it is pictured....it is a very dark, navy blue.  Very dark.  Also, the sizes run big.  Every t-shirt i own is a size Large.....this shirt is a size large, but is WAY too big. Be warned
B000G2KOHG:way_over-rated,_not_a_great_shoe_at_all!:leila_aleryan_"laleryan"	1.0	Although very cute, Crocs are not good shoes.  They are a cheap, plastic shoe that is over priced and NOT comfortable at all.  I bought a pair for my two year old daughter because of the ease to clean them and because they are "non slip".  She did slip in them, many times and the worse part is that they gave her huge terrible red blisters on the side of her feet.  They are the right size but I just think they are not made well.

Don't go for the hype. They are a useless shoe.
B0000TW2A2:dont_listen_to_other_reviews_-_total_joke!!:rose_red	1.0	first of all, they dont even go up TO the thigh!  they attempt to sit right above the knee!!

second, THEY DO NOT STAY UP AT ALL WHATSOEVER!!! I was sooooo embarrassed - i went out with them on and every ten seconds I was pulling them back up.....

I am 5'3" and I weigh about 125....I'm average - these are a joke - price IS too good to be true - DO NOT BU
B000EDLYHQ:thin_and_cheap_feeling:l._beeler	1.0	I purchased this item thinking that it would make a nice gift, but upon receiving it found it looks and feels like something from a dollar store, and it's not even worth the dollar.  
  Very cheezy item.
B0001EKMFS:too_small:vickie_s._pflueger_"wannabe_digital_diva"	1.0	Ordered mens 6.5 for my son, shoes are sized a womans 6.5 (say mens 6.5 on box and shoe).  I'm going to have to pay $6.50 to return them for a larger size.  Don't waste your money, Buy NIkes
B00020O798:good_weight,_but_quality_suffers:arn_malliett	2.0	My review appears to be inconsistent with the others.  Weeks after I received my jacket I had to take it to a seamstress to have stitching repaired in several places.  This is not following heavy use, but wearing the jacket one or two days a week walking to my car and from the car to the office.  In addition, the metal snaps should be replaced with buttons for a better look.  When considering the cost of the jacket, shipping and repairs, I should have to gone to Macys and purchased a nicer jacket.
B000273PGM:credit:jane_doe	1.0	Waited weeks and still waiting to date for a credit. Very unhappy with return policy.  Wondering if I'll ever get my credit
B000JKLSQG:crazy_measurements:sharon_wiegand_"lauren"	2.0	I just received this dress today. Not only was it cheaply made (there are rhinestones missing, threads, and it doesn't flow smoothly), the top of the dress will have you falling out all over the place if you are in any other position than standing completely straight. Also, the support is badly made. I have a very small bust, but I don't think this would compliment anyone who isn't built like Barbie. Definitely wouldn't recommend. It looks great in the picture, but it's not being modelled on a real person.
B000E1VHBQ:total_crap_boots!:z._heward	1.0	I thought I was going to save a few bucks and buy my next Combat Boots from Amazon to get the cheapest price.  The seller was totally fine, however the boots were total crap.  The leather was unbelievably stiff and hard, so I thought I would just use a ton of leather conditioner... about 15 applications and I don't think it made a difference.  I put the boots on to try and "break them in" - lost cause there, but in addition, nearly half the eyelets came right out of the lether, first or second time trying the boots on.  I would have returned the, except I had shined and polished, and oiled the boots so much.  Don't buy, stick with Altama or another Military Issue brand boot.  I am sticking with my Altama pair I have had for 7 years
B000GEP1VS:buyer_beware:sam	1.0	First of all they didn't sent me the pictured panties, but boyshorts in a weird blueish psychedelic print. Butt-ugly. Second, they are from a flimsy mesh fabric that looks really cheap and declasse. Returned right away. Very disappointing
B000085HYD:sight_unseen_wallet:larry_d._keller	2.0	Not very good pictures or description.Wallet was smaller than I expected.Quality was OK,not competitively priced
B000CD6DII:don't_buy_unless_looks_dont_matter:kent	2.0	So I just got my shoes after waiting two long weeks....what a dissapointment. I open the box and immediately I see what appears to be a defect. The inside of the shoe (like on your right foot, the left side, not the right) was covered in little black dots that were smudged all over the grey area, including smudging on the asics logo. This was obviously a manufacturing defect seein it was the same color as the logo which was also smudged. Also, the shoe glue was leaking out the back of the shoe. Poorly done, last time I will ever buy ASICS shoes again
B000JTCUMI:received_an_empty_box:samie_may_"samie_may"	1.0	I can't say much for the shoes, but Amazon goofed up on this one.  They shipped out an empty box.  Luckily UPS caught it and sent notice to Amazon for me.
B0007Z7MMM:beware!!!!!:k._m._hill	1.0	Seller will not honor prices listed...then if you leave seller negative feedaback..AMAZON WILL REMOVE IT!!! Do not trust seller ratings..they are false!!!!
B000BTPTGU:very_small:j._chafer	2.0	Lookslike it would be a nice product, but it's only for very small babies up to 12 pounds and 23 inches. My baby is very long and just doesn't fit - wish Target/Amazon would have been more upfront with the sizing
B000FVL7P6:one_size_-_no_indication_of_the_one_size_is_xl:ba	1.0	We have not opened the package. The item is advertised as one size. Without a notice that the one size is not "One Size fits all" It is XL (Grand Plus for those that speak french). My wife wears a size 2 or 4. Obviously this was a waste of money
B000CGSUWM:do_not_buy.:tristan	1.0	This hoodie is very poorly made. I bought a blue version and I had to return it after washing it in COLD water on GENTLE. It faded substantially, changed shape, and the threading came loose. Not recommended!!
B000CFLR3M:too_thin_not_bad_design:michael_l._higgins_"pocket_pool"	1.0	These garments were so thin as to not do many of the things one expects of underwear.
B000EVKO8I:not_the_material_i_wanted:andrésmh	2.0	It won't help you get dry, it's more of a robe to hang out. I had to return it and the seller was really nice and gave me a refund
B0002KU8VE:not_so_good:stephanie_austin	1.0	These bras do not hold up very well. I started wearing them in June after the birth of my son and I have already had to throw both of them away - six months later
B0002KU8VE:support:carrie_ott_"carrott"	1.0	I ordered this nursing bra after looking at several and reading other reviews on this product. I received the product in good condition and in an appropriate time frame. That is where the only star I am giving is coming from.
I am concerned with having a good supportive bra. I have fairly large breasts and do not want to be sagging to my knees in 50 years. This bra is the farthest thing from supportive. I had to cut the straps and re-sew them to make them shorter so I could even where it. The material is soft, but thin and stretchy. I have never ordered a clothing item over the internet before and I will not again
B00008MN6P:most_horrible_bra_i_have_ever_bought:katiba_"katiba"	1.0	I have been a 34 size for my entire life and this bra fits terrible...the fabric is stiff and so uncomfortable..I could not wait to take it off. Champion should stick to making sports bra...do not buy this bra or you will suffer. Plus, it looks much thinner in the picture..it is really thick...it feels like a maternity bra. UGH
B000FBQVYI:what_can_you_expect_form_a_$10_pair_of_sunglasses?:cody_mclain	2.0	These broke within the first 3 days of use. 2 screws for one lense came loose and the other lense started to crack near where the screw insert is located
B0007VJ61Q:shipping_problems:kate_hep	2.0	On Sept 17 I ordered a cashmere wrap. I finally got the company's attention when I placed a negative review on this forum. I was told if I removed the review after recieving the item, I would be credited for shipping. The item arrived Oct 16. As of today, November 20, my credit card had not been credited. I emailed the company and was told the credit should appear in four to five days.
B0009K5V5A:way_way_way_too_small:sean_l._craft_"crafty"	1.0	OK, I am not overly modest and 95% of the shorts/pants I buy fit when I purchase and XL size.  These shorts are made for anorexic bean poles.  If you have thighs, legs or even a *tiny* bit of junk in the trunk, forget it.  These are designed for 16 year old girls, not men.  Shipping is also super slow
B000FI9XBY:shoes:gayla_gonzales_"rebelthis42"	1.0	The picture of the shoes was deceiving.  Did not want ankle strap.  You could not
go by the picture.  Which is how you do online shopping. Returned the shoes.
B000FI9XBY:report_wedge:laurie_poiroux_"lpoiroux"	1.0	Buyers be aware that the picture does not show the correct shoe. The real shoe has an ankle strap. Also, the shoe seemed to run a half size smaller. I had to return the shoe and lose out on shipping costs
B000L7X3XS:everything_was_good_except_._._.:robert_barnett_".net_developer"	1.0	The skin is fine and all the extras were nice. The one thing I really needed was a good elastic band for the arm. This product does not have a good elastic band. It's too thin and not durable enough
B000GHN8H4:too_narrow!:isaac_fan_"rakushka"	2.0	These boots look very nice, but unfortunately, it is way too narrow (and I have narrow feet).  My whole foot felt squashed.  Back to Amazon it goes
B000B85LP0:cheap_pool_shoe:cynshopper	1.0	This shoe is like having a hard piece of plastic under foot
B0006N2C2U:too_small:michael_a._uliano_"giantsfan"	1.0	These socks do not fit the sizes specified. The elastic is so tight that you can hardly get them on your feet. I gave them to my 12 yr. old son and they were too tight on him also, I threw them out. This is the first and last time I will buy those socks. The Reebok sneakers are great though
B000EXS0MS:rockport_slip-on:d._l._smith	1.0	I wear a lot of Rockport shoes. Almost exclusively. I was very disappointed in these shoes. They are the same "size" as all of the other Rockports I have, yet they are too small
B0002USHBW:who_makes_these_shoes?:marla_"marla"	2.0	Same as the capezio jazz shoes, Way to small for normal people.  None of the kids(48) could fit into the shoes, in the sizes that where recommended.  All had to go up at least 2-3 sizes larger and almost all needed the wides. Very frustrating.  Makes me want to start my own dance shoe business-not for profit.
B00009WPT2:hanes_toeless_hosiery:s._l._cox	1.0	Not comfortable.  The "thong" between your toes is too thick and too tight.  If you are looking for toeless, this is not the way to go.  Try DKNY hosiery instead.  Expensive, but worth it for the comfort factor and they are very durable
B000GRNV8A:missing_piece:k._blough	2.0	When the product came it was torn and had one of the three pieces missing.  I called the seller and they said all of the purses were missing one piece. I would not order from this seller unless you are not worried about all the pieces
B0000DGLF5:worst_sneakers_ever:victor_kolosov_"vkolosov"	1.0	I wish I could give them -5 stars.
I got these to replace a pair of New Balance 999 that I had for almost 10 years thinking that the quality of shoes that cost around $170 should be really good. I couldn't be more wrong. The lining of these shoes started falling apart a just after 3 month of wearing them and not even every day!!! Stay away at all cost
B000GU8556:desription_is_not_correct:megan_cunningham	2.0	i thought this purse was cute but upon receiving it, i was disappointed. the purse is black with silver buckles but the stitching is a gold color and does not go well with the rest of the purse. also i have tried to return it and have not been able to get a hold of anybody to help me
B000F710ZC:disappointing_unfortunately:ms._m_"bookworm"	2.0	The other day I excitedly tried this bra on at Walmart.  I couldn't believe I could possibly purchase a strapless bra without going to a specialty store.  

Unfortunately the bra does not appear to be made for those with fuller figures despite its claims.  Depending on the company I am a 38 DD or 34FF.  I tried this bra on in a 38 DD.  I was impressed with the way it molded to me but was unimpressed with the support.  Basically under a shirt I sagged as if I was wearing no bra at all.  That is not the effect I want when I go strapless.  Only Goddess seems to have the ability to create full-figured bras that give the same support in strapless bras that you expect from the strapped variety
B000FQ7NH2:nice_but_small:craig_thompson	2.0	Bag was well made, but too small.  Can't put much in it.  Nice well-made leather bag.  If it was three times bigger it would be a perfect.
B000CMFJ7U:time_to_find_a_new_favorite:luciana_mccadden_"dissapointed"	1.0	I was excited to get my first pair of 992 and was certain that they would be every bit as good as the 991; however, I had many of the same negative experiences other reviewers have had.  The shoe is hard, uncomfortable, and much wider than the 991.  My foot slides around everywhere.  I recomend buying these shoes only if you are buying them for thier looks and then only after trying them on first.  Don't be mistaken by thinking you can just buy a 992 in the same size and width that you wear in a 991
B000CMFJ7U:992's_are_a_horrible_shoe,_beware,_make_sure_you_can_return_them:l._peckus	1.0	I absolutely agree with Brett A. Warner these replacements feel horrible . They don't have the instant great feeling you got when you put the 991's on. I bought them at a local store which did not take returns. So they just sit in the closet. If you do purchase these make sureyou can return them because you will. I wear a 11 1/2
B000CMFJ7U:do_not_buy_these_shoes_for_running!:brett_a._warner	1.0	I have run in a pair of 991s for the last 5 years.  I was disappointed to hear that the 991 was replaced by the 992.  I purchased a pair of 992 hoping for similar comfort and fit.  The 992s are nice to look at, but the similarities stop there.  The fit is horrible even after going down from a D to a B width.  The cushioning I've come to love in the 991 is simiply not there in the 992.  I had a New Balance representative tell me point blank that he wouldn't recommend the 992 for running at all.  What is that old adage?  If it's not broke don't fix it.  Did New Balance even test this shoe before implementing it?  991 lovers beware, this shoe is not for you.  I guess the quest begins for a new running shoe
B0006MTE4U:best._jeans._nevah.:j._b._philhower_"ardent_online_shopper"	2.0	Big for the size advertised, not fitting as snugly for pear shaped gals. Hoped it would shrink, since I'm a perfect 6, and it didn't. Disappointed
B000A379OC:cut_very_small:julia_j._rosenberger_"jules"	2.0	this is the SMALLEST extra large I have ever bought, my daughter is 125lbs and wears a size 2 dress and it's SUPER tight on her.... this was very disappointing to say the least.... if you normally wear a small in other things, I would suggest you buy the extra large in this. The quality of the material is GREAT that's what made me even give this product a 2..
B000JZX3J6:very_disappointing.:p._kuncl_"-pk"	1.0	I purchased the non-premium kit ($9.99) with a Silicone skin case cover and 2 screen protectors (one for each screen), but it is the same case.  The problem is that the silicone skin cover is slippery, twice as slippery as the Nintendo Lite without the cover. We thought that washing them in Dove dish soap would wash away the slipperyness, but that didn't work. After handling the cover, your hands have a slippery residue on them.  The other issue is that the cover is so thin that it is little more than scratch protection, not impact protection.  The screen covers that come with the non-premium kit are ok, I guess, but one of them had 2 defect particles that were raised (trust me, the screen was clean).  

I purchased 2 kits, and I had one screen protector defect and my wife accidentally broke one of the silicone covers hinge straps with little effort.  I do not recommend this product at all
B000EOXTZK:no_luv_from_luvable_friends_-_poor_quality:j._gottlieb	1.0	I bought a pack of long sleeve and pack of short sleeve onsies for my 18 month old. Luvable Friend's onsies are awful. The biggest issue is that they use velcro instead of snaps to secure the onesies. And the velcro doesn't even stick. They becomes undone and fly loose within minutes. Also the sizing is way too large for the average 18 month old. Lastly even the shirt tag stinks. It is this cheap oversized tag that I had to cut off because it was so uncomfortable to my son. Shame on them for making such a cheap product - shame on you if you buy these onsies after reading this review!
B0007MG8WU:do_not_buy_this_if_you_are_large_chested!:i._l._young_"aquaopal"	1.0	I was excited to FINALLY find a black nursing bra.  This bra fits horribly.  Do not buy if you are DD/E cup!  This bra is uncomfortable and doesn't hold your goods properly
B000FPEQK0:amazon's_price_is_way_out-of-line_on_this_item:frank_r._savory_"frsavory"	2.0	While I can't agree with the other reviewer RE the quality of the 560 jeans (it seems excellent to me, having owned six pairs over the last two years, which I wear to work every day), and certainly as men's jeans, I don't think they're "out of style", I do have to say Amazon's price on this item is far, far out-of-line.  You can find these same jeans online elsewhere for $38 (with free or cheap shipping), meaning the cost is nearly $20 less than what Amazon is charging
B000FPEQK0:out_of_style!:redsfan1358_"redsfan1358"	1.0	OUT OF STYLE!

All the girls make fun of me for wearing Levi jeans. They say it is a sure sign of being old and out of style.

The fit, quality, durability, and comfort level do not seem to be as good as they were two decades ago. There is definitely a noticeable difference, and not a positive one.

The price far exceeds the value - OVERPRICED!
B000JDUDC8:slip-off_slip-ons:a._johnson_"katys_mom"	1.0	These slippers are very comfy and fit true to size.  However, the fabric  part between the toes is not anchored to the solid part of the slipper.  It's sewn to the terry lining covering this solid part and when I walk, the slippers fall off my feet. I will not purchase these slippers again.
B000GVYOXM:disappointing:nursing_mom	1.0	This seller fails to state that the snap is in the inner lower corner of each cup which is probably why its so cheap.  When I opened the package and unsnapped the cup the entire snap fell off.  When I emailed Alys's customer service they said only unopened merchandise is returnable.  Needless to say, I don't recommend this bra
B0000CD9U7:doesn't_hide_nipple_protrusion:annon	1.0	I really wanted this product to work, but it really didn't help with my problem. I always have erect nipples no matter what and this really doesn't fully flatten them, or make them less noticeable with t-shirts, etc
B0000CD9U7:these_don't_work:c._cox	1.0	I was so disappointed in these. I am full-busted (38DD) and my nipples are sensitive and show through my bra and shirts all the time.  I used a band-aid and it did a better job.  These provided no help at all. AND they REALLY HURT taking them off
B0000CD9U7:don't_cover_my_pokies!:d._buehler_"bduo"	2.0	These didn't do the job as far as keeping my nipples from poking out so much. They do have great adhesive. Also no good if you are trying to hide the darkness of the areola, because they are pretty small. I used every pair, just thinking I was putting them on poorly, but everytime, I was a pokin
B0000CD9U7:not_so_good:imani42_"imani"	1.0	The nippits didn't really work for me and they were painful to remove
B00008IPE0:unbearably_itchy!:snowbird	1.0	I love toeless hosiery, but these are the most uncomfortable pantyhose I have ever worn.  If I'm sitting down at all the backs of my thighs start to itch so horribly, and it gets worse when I stand.  These are awful, I can't stand it.  The only good things I can say are unlike some toeless pantyhose I have worn in the past, the toe thong does not bind, and the lightest color actually is light enough for my skin tone, but it is so not worth the itching.  Also, they run rather large, the material doesn't have nearly enough stretch and they bag around the ankles and knees.  I'm only 5 feet tall but out over 120 lbs. and the smallest size is still too big.  I'll give Hue's a try and I might even spring for the Donna Karan toeless panythose, but I won't get these ones again
B000G11JLW:its_going_to_break!:lebigmac_"lebigmac"	1.0	it tore apart while running and smashed into a million pieces. 
look at tuneBelt. They have one that fits pretty good
B000AOSAFS:disappointed_in_quality:bonnie_mcdowell	1.0	I was disappointed when I got the shoes and one of them was made with inferior suede and very thin.I emailed the company I bought them from and requested an exchange/return many times. They never responded and I ended up keeping the shoes as I needed them for work. I would not purchase from this company again.
B0002VC16I:i_wouldn't_buy_from_them...:mo_"tomo"	1.0	I wouldn't order from Andrew Christion again!  I ordered three shirts more than a month ago.  They sent only two and never responded to my emails!  Where's my shirt!!?
B000CRER78:ughhhhhhhhhhhh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:n._caden-larsen_"lllll"	2.0	I was givin this case for christmas and I thought it was great for the first month...................then I took it off to get some dust off the screen and my screen was totally scratched and it also scratched the space above the click wheel and below the screen.  I am a total scratch freak but still I was really mad.  WARNING: if YOU don't like your iPod scratched DO NOT get this case!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000CRER78:do_not_buy_this_case:joshua_e._gacek	1.0	I purchased a iPod video and the case has scratched up the screen around the outside.  On the inside of the case they've got some ruff edges that will damage you iPod screen.  

If you'd like scratches on your iPod screen then purchase this case, but if you'd like to keep your screen from being scratched then STAY AWAY FROM THIS CASE!
B000NUHBMC:where's_the_butter?:god's_girl	2.0	the crocs butter turned out to be a sponge with a light infusion of some sort of oil which you rub on the shoes.  I have used it about three or four times and I don't feel it will last much longer. What there was of it seemed to work well, but it seems rather a waste of money considering the amount of actual use.
B000NUHBMC:not_worth_the_money:a_reviewer	1.0	I purchased the Crocs Butter thinking it would be something special just for Crocs shoes.  As soon as I opened the package, I noticed the Crocs Butter is just like any other shoe buffer/cleaner with the black sponge.  I already own two shoe buffers, one of which I received free with purchase from a local shoe store.  Needless to say, I returned the Crocs Butter, since it's not worth $4.95, plus $10 shipping, which I was not refunded.  What a crock
B000ABDSVC:not_what_i_expected!!:t._braggs	1.0	These were not as expected, there was no cap to cover the holes where the wheels are at so if he decided to take out the wheels, there was just an open hole. He has problems using these too!
B000H42HLY:nine_west_efney_sandal:k._segar	1.0	This shoe is extrememly uncomfortable!!  The straps at the toes run right across so your pinky toe gets seperated and will get caught under the toenail.  I won't ever wear them again
B000I9YH4I:has_weird_arms:nicholas_m._folts_"nikk"	2.0	The jacket we received had weird arms, they had a hole for the thumb, and then another for the rest of the fingers. Great for skiing or snowboarding, but for casual use in Florida winter wasn't very practical. Columbia in general is a company I swear by
B000089G7X:too_much:edith_c._hallenbeck	1.0	I realize anyone admitting to wearing a 3X is in trouble in the conservation of fabric, but this manutacturer must be very generous.   The garment was SO LARGE I could have made two out of the one unit.  This certainly was an error in sizing or I am smaller than I thought.  I hesitate to purchase from this retailer because I can not trust their product sizes and sending stuff is expensive and a hassle
B0001ILR1W:hate_this_bra!:v._ritter	1.0	I hate this bra.  The elastic band is NOT soft and rolls up as the day wears on.  Shoulder straps are skinny & inadequate.  Only good thing is that it is low-cut.  I prefer my $12 nursing bras purchased at Wal-Mart.  I only wear this one if those are unavailable or my shirt is low-cut
B000B8LTHY:no_headache_midsize_purple_visor:susan_a._smith	1.0	The mid-size is actually quite large.  Had I to do it over again, I would just get the original size because that would be sufficient.  I like a bit of sun but just not in my eyes!  I found that when wearing it in a boat with the wind at my face as we traveled, it stayed on very well.  That was a concern that I had since many visors flip off in heavy wind currents.  I did get a slight headache from it but not as bad as other visors.  The visor part seems to be a hard plastic with a light cloth material covering.  I chose purple and it is a beautiful shade.  The bows that go around your head are made of some soft comfortable material and they go farther around your head than other standard visors.
B000BK2DRC:nice_"looking"_gloves:n._titan	2.0	These gloves should really be called "Simulation Leather". They are warm and comfortable but the outer layer is some kind of thin black plastic that looks like leather.

I wouldnt feel comfortable riding a Motorcycle with these, if you hit the pavent with them they'd probably just vaporize
B0001449Y8:false_item_description_by_seller!!!:yekaterina_y._petrova	1.0	As much as seller might like this backpack to be 11" by 8.5" by 6.5", the one I've got is surely not that big (10"x8"x4" at best!), and as a result of this it is totally unsuitable for me since notebooks would absolutely not fit into it (and judging by the size the seller decided to advertise, was it what they were aiming for?). The material is ok, so is the craftsmanship, but the fact that they  lied (yes! l-i-e-d!) about the size just completely spoils the whole deal. A great dissapointment!!! :
B000BNACOK:just_ok:c._m._windey	2.0	i have had my bag for a couple of months.  the liner on the inside has already ripped
B000CNMPQW:these_are_huge!!_:kim_m._barnes_"kim"	2.0	i always wear a small so i bought two pairs of these in a small and neither fit they fall right off my hips!
B000BNQDX4:if_the_shoe_fits...:carl_m._evans_"mooncrow"	1.0	I ordered a 11.5EEE size slip-on shoe.  Despite the labelling in the shoes, they felt more like 12.5EE.  In other words, too tight across the arch; and so loose on the heel they wore like flip-flops.  Unfortunately, the only way to truely measure the wearing comfort of shoes is to wear them, which voids the company's product return policy.  Anybody want a worn-once pair of shoes... cheap?
B000MTDG0K:horrific:gema	1.0	The top was very roughly finished. The end of the blue part that crosses the chest did not stay in place,because the seams on it were very rough, so I had to take the whole part out because it made the top look more crooked than it is supossed to be. The top got COMPLETELY ruined on the first wash, I followed the instructions to a "T" during washing but still the blue on the top ran and I had to throw it away. The skirt is still fine after washing it twice but I would not recommend this outfit to anybody
B000E0ZG00:not_even_vanity_fair:c._christlieb	1.0	I love Vanity Fair. Their bras just fit me perfectly. When this bra arrived I quickly found it was not Vanity fair. Not only that, but it was made of the most rough and uncomfortable material. I tried it on in hopes it may fit. It was the most uncomfortable bra I have ever tried on. Not because of size. It was bulky, rough and obviously inexpensively made. The tag said something along the lines of, "Made in Hong Kong.
B000CQUWXC:two_different_shoes:shoebee	1.0	The main shoe photo is not the shoe that is sent with your order.  Amazon had said they would rectify the error, although it looks like the main photo still shows the shoe with the circle-buckle, and the shoe that is sent has long ankle ties, and a different strap entirely
B0000W2GG4:pantyhose_had_snags_when_they_arrived:a._andrews	1.0	First time I've ordered a product from Leg Avenue - and it'll probably be my last!  I opened up the package and the pantyhose already had 4 "runs" in one of the legs before I even tried them on.  What a waste of money...and if I would pay to ship them back for another pair then I've already put way too much money into, what should be, an inexpensive product
B0002IC4VI:"you_get_what_you_pay"_is_always_true:n._tung	2.0	The glasses look fine... from a far distance. They are produced very carelessly. Given that it's on sale, the quality can not be as high as normal. However, it should not that bad
B000E73S4Y:good_buy_but....:k._devaney	2.0	I thought the price of the glasses was too good to turn down so i decided to go through with the purchase. When i received the product they looked very cheap and poorly made. Throughout the first day i had the glasses they broke in the bag, which was in my pocket. I then tried to fix them and finally realized they could never be fixed.
B000BO3OE4:misrepresentation:katherine_smalls_"fashion_biz"	1.0	I was disappointed with the shoes when I received them.  On the website, the shoes looked Gold in color and were described as Gold, but when I received the shoes they were beige.  I am sorry to say that I could not wear the shoes.
B0002IC1O8:1_star_for_deceptive_placement:j._n._bray_"sunglass_mafia"	1.0	These are NOT RAY BANS! They should not come up when I do a search for Ray bans. Get your cheap CRAP out of my search for GENUINE Ray Bans
B000134YGW:too_much_girlfriend:puddin_tane_"ask_me_again!"	2.0	I got two problems with this here lingeree:
1. That model at the top of the page is sparkin hot, how come it never looks the same on my girlfriend?  EH?  False advertizing if ya ask me.  Their shold be a law that all lingeree models hafta weigh 250 and have a bit of hair on their legs like my woman does. Or a warnin label "Objects inside this lingeree are uglier than they appear."
2.  I paid $14.95 and there aint enough there to blow yer nose on. My suggestion: go for the crotchless OR the bustless OR the fishnet, but all three is just not enough lingeree and too much girlfriend..
B000F9YQF6:unsatisfied:grimey's_mom	1.0	My son picked out these shoes for basketball. He liked them at first and gave them time to get broke-in, but the outsides of the shoes had no give. Most shoe will form to your foot, these did not. At the end of third stripe, you could feel a big ridge on the inside of the shoe.We had to buy a different pair of shoes that formed to his foot better. Nice looking shoe, but not the greatest fit
B000A3ZEM6:uncomfortable!!!!:mrs._r	1.0	I have been wearing boyshorts for ages, and I gave these ones a try because they were on sale and were really cute. The fit is HORRIBLE!!! The seam down the middle constantly rides up into very uncomfortable places. I mean, the whole point of a boyshort is to not have to pick wedgies! I even bought them a size larger, because some brands tend to fit a little snug
B000GARHQE:i_got_ripped_off:s._marcum	1.0	i ordered this product from general_discounters and I have tried for 4 wks. and still I have not gotten a response from them and I havent received my order. As far as the actual cologne, it is nice but order it from that company and you'll not get to smell it because you wont get it. All other potential buyers of this cologne beware of the seller and make sure if its 4 days or more late contact seller
B000F15JKK:this_sword_picture_is_a_real_foil._it_does_not_match_description!:m._valiant_"pirateswordsman"	1.0	I am not happy with what I got in the mail today. I thought I was getting a real used fencing foil. Instead, I got a kids plastic fencing sword!

Sending it back ASAP to get my account credited for sure!

Why is a real sword picture used to sell a kids fencing foil
B000N578C0:is_there_a_zero_star?:j._campbell	1.0	I bought this item because it said "optional belt clip."  The belt clip is only "optional" if you "opt" to leave it on and not use it.  You cannot "opt" to take it off.  I would not call this belt clip "optional."  I would call it "will ruin your new phone case if you attempt to remove it," which is what happened to me mere moments after taking it out of the paper envelope it shipped in
B000F8UCZA:on_your_feet_women's_fritz_flat_embellished_thong:jasmine	2.0	I wish I did not order this one. The picture looks nice but when I got it today, I really got disappointed. When you look at it closer, the wood beads, sequins and the cloth are very cheap looking. I wish they used nicer sequins and glossy beads.
B000J4JLIO:company_does_not_actually_stock_this_belt.:mark_bloom	1.0	I ordered 5 of these belt buckles. The company sent the wrong items 2 times before finally admitting they didn't actually have this belt. I needed the belts for a deadline and if they had told me the first time that it wasn't in stock I could have ordered it elsewhere
B00008KI3U:true_is_the_stitch_that_digs:b._dooda_"bbbddd"	2.0	These tighty whiteys are close to being a perfect everyday bikini. However, as another reviewer noted, there is a large seam on the right side which will dig into your hip and will actually leave a dent in your skin. I'm normally a 32 waist and the pairs that I own are for my size, medium 32-34. Streching the band and breaking some of the elastic can slay the wicked seam, but I've also ripped pairs clean in half trying to do this. Maybe buying the next size up would work, but that might mean giving your boys too big of a yard to play in and I like keeping 'em close to home.
B00008KI3U:uncomfortable.:fiid_williams_"fiid"	2.0	I bought some of these - I find they have a large seam on the right side which digs into my skin and is quite uncomfortable.  Other than that they are OK, but because of this I mostly wear these inside out
B00008KI3U:low_quality..._uncomfortable:	1.0	Look a little harder if you want an alternative to boxers and bland briefs.  The Elance is poorly made and designed, Jockey is barely evern trying.  Look on the web guys, there are better choices.... Jockey's Elance and the similar department store knockoffs of womens underwear are lame
B00024R7QY:more_trouble_than_it's_worth:emily's_mom	1.0	I am not leaking so I don't need those annoying papery pads, but I would still like a little padded protection, so I was hoping this bra would do the trick.  Well, it served that purpose alright, but it was a pain as far as nursing went.  The clasp was difficult to release with one hand.  The cup could not be completely pushed out of the way during nursing making it annoying for baby and making discretion difficult.  Worst of all, the underwire gave me a rash!  This bra may work for some, but not for me..
B0002PC5DS:felt_like_i_had_a_wedgie...:s._"strap"	1.0	Like a permanent wedgie, these kept riding up my crack.  I don't recommend these at all...the liquid metallic look is only useful if you're going to be a male stripper.  Otherwise, you've got liquid metal up your crack...not very appealing
B000F4WT00:very_comfy,_but_ugly.:c._fritsche	2.0	You can't beat this shoe for comfort, but they're definately cuter in the picture.  I thought they made my feet appear extra long and the heel didn't quite seem to fit the shoe.  I returned them.
B000E0T4E4:pointy:me	1.0	I agree.  Cup had too much left at the end and all I can say is pointy
B000E0T4E4:it_sucks:poor_artist	1.0	the bra cup itself is too big for my chest. and although interesting to look at because it looks like a bra women may have worn daily in the 30's and 40's it is not at all comfortable.  blah!  and i love vanity fair so its disappointing for sure
B0007WLQZE:poor_design:california_grandmother	2.0	I bought this hat for my 4 year old granddaughter for Christmas. She loved it.  The downside: the elastic stretch band on the inside of the hat was so tight that the hat would not sit on her head without popping off.  We would have returned it but it was Christmas morning and my granddaughter was thrilled with the concept of having a cowgirl hat.  We ultimately solved the problem by cutting out the elastic band and the hat now fits just fine!  I guess the elastic band is supposed to make the hat fit various sized heads but it is beyond me how the hat would stay on anyone's head
B0007WLQZE:don't_like_this_at_all!:1tennisnut	1.0	This hat is not suitable for a small child.  It is WAY too big and the material it is made of is too hard and stiff. If I had been there when it arrived, I would have sent it back
B000HKNVCC:cute_with_capris,_skirts,_pants;_but_kind_of_uncomfortable:e._j._wright	2.0	I have these in black, and while I find them to go with just about every outfit I wear to work, I wish they were just a little (read: quite a lot) less uncomfortable. Firstly, the insole provided doesn't seem to fit the inside of the shoe properly. Almost like it's too wide. My foot is neither narrow nor wide, so this isn't something I typically notice about a shoe. There is an arch, but because of the weirdly shaped insole it doesn't provide any support. The zig zap strap is a really cute feature that I love, but it just adds to the uncomfort of the shoe. You can tighten the strap to keep your foot from sliding around inside, but then it cuts off circulation and leaves painful imprints. If you leave it too loose then you leave your feet pretty unstable. 

All in all, a versatile mary jane with good looks but no comfort
B000JCYEX8:very_uncomfortable:online_shopper_22_"os22"	1.0	These slippers are anything but comfortable. Besides the sizing being to small, I felt like I was putting my foot into a kid's slipper. The width is way to small to be comfortable on anyone's foot, and the inside material is also anything but comfortable.
B000JCYEX8:the_worst_purchase_i_have_ever_made:greta_politano_"greta"	1.0	It is ironic that you would send this to me.  I can not tell you how excited I was to purchase these slippers.  I had bought everyone in my family UGG slippers for Christmas.  Everyone had cozy slippers but me.....SO instead of paying over $60 I found this pair of Warmbat on amazon.  I researched the brand and thought they may be a good match.  I received the slippers as amazon promised in a timely manner.  The next day the right slipper fell apart the stitching and the bottom of slipper fell off.  I was upset and sewed them, and glued them.  The following week the left slipper fell apart.  I did not want to go thru the process of shipping back the slippers, they were $29.00. SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO disappointed.  Please forward to WARMBAT
B000LGGYM6:indian_print_cotton_full_length_ladies_skirt_:erica_l._morgan	2.0	There was no 'draw string waist' and it didnt fit, complete waste of money. (Yeah I realize they do returns but usually companies send you packages and slips to return merchandise with fast and efficient and there were neither.) Didnt fit actual description was off and 'ships within 24 hours means 24 hours after whatever, point being I didnt get the package for like 3 weeks when I was out of town and didnt have time to return it. Ive bought skirts at a quarter of this price and they were made of much better material and didnt take 3 weeks to get to me.  Just be smart.
B000GFJ70S:not_good_enough,_f--:kelley_lynn_schaperjahn	2.0	This is a piece of garbage. It's cute-looking, and *just barely* will fit *just* your DS and maybe a few games and the cleaning cloth, but as far as any kind of long-term travel functionality, look elsewhere. The charger doesn't fit in there very well, which I don't think is an unreasonable demand for a handheld device carrying case. I was able to squeeze both my DS Lite and the charger in there for awhile, but recently the zipper broke, and I had to split it apart to get to my stuff, and now it's useless. If all you want is something to carry just the DS in, this is a decent option. Otherwise, forget it
B000GFJ70S:poor_fit:janna_l._harris_"sirra"	1.0	I purchased this item for my granddaughter who is 13 for use with her Nintendo DS Lite. The case does not fit at all and I have had to search for a different type of case to fit her game
B000GFJ70S:not_worth_the_money:michelle_l._grimm	2.0	This carrying case was a terrible purchase.  The zipper broke within hours and the Nintendo DS Lite doesn't really fit into it very well.  I was very disappointed.  My six year old used his own money to buy a G-Pak case, which is a much better case for the Nintendo DS Lite
B0002LINCY:items_not_yet_received:fotini_menegaki	1.0	Until today, 01/09/2007, I did not yet receive item Hi-Cut Brief 7_8701_1176 XL/Light Beige

nor Bali Lace Trim Moderate Control Hi-Cut Brief 8044 XL/Light Beige

both purchased on 11/30/200
B0001YR20G:getting_impatient:james_e._straut	2.0	the product was received on 6/18. When I tried it on I found it to be too large, Utilizing the return form included with the order I completed it and returned the item via UPS on 6/20. I'm still not sure about the return policy! When I hadn't heard from The Uniform Company after about 2 weeks I called them. I was informed that they did in fact receive my return but the size that I needed, Large, was not in stock and it would be 4 to 5 days before it could be shipped. I'm still waiting! When I get the product I can properly review it
B000B8G4FG:not_what_i_expected:pa_student	2.0	I just purchased 5 pairs of the dickies everyday scrubs (from another online company) because they seemed inexpensive, durable, and came in many fun colors. I was sorely disappointed. The colors are pretty, but the material is  crummy. Its rough, flimsy and feels like plastic. The pastel colors (citron, cool mint etc) are almost see-through and definitely show patterned underwear. The tops run quite large (i wear a 6-8 on top and the medium is VERY Roomy, i would definitely get a small if i were to ever order them again).
B000EIJIB0:never_got_my_item!:vinyetta_k._butler_"lady_libra"	1.0	I ordered a pair of scrubs for a friend to be sent to my P.O. Box but the seller used UPS which won't send packages to P.O. Boxes so I gave an alternate address. I've never recieved the scrubs for my friend. I've sent e-mails inquiring about my order and haven't recieved any word back. I've been cheated out of my money.
B000I5JSQY:not_really_a_cover_up:cdeen	1.0	These "cover ups" are very thin, a scratchy material not very comfortable to wear in the hot sun.  The colors are pretty, but the size is not really conducive to cute styles and wraps.  They are cheap, good thing because I can't imagine what to use them for.  I'd return them but the postage would cost more than the item.
B000B43JGM:not_enough__information:roger_b._marroquin_"daddyr"	1.0	I was a bit dissapointed , i know its my fault , i didn't pay to much attention to the tag that is not the color they show the one you are ordering, it SHOULD be the same thing you're looking physically the thing you're gonna buy!!!
i saw this beautifull gray/orange stripes, and got GREEN /WHITE STRIPÈS.
its very easy to put a picture of the product!!

regard
B0000A0RS3:maternity_shorts_:robyn_m._lowenstein_"robyn"	1.0	just didn't like the way they turned out....medium size ran way too big for me too. I didn't know how to return so I just kept them.
B0007KNN3Y:not_recommended!:t._bui_"regular_amazon_customer"	1.0	Although the dress may seem to fit the ideal dress from the movie, How to Lose a Guy in 10 Days, the cut of the dress leaves extra fabric right under the area of the bust. This made me look awkward and did not fit well. Don't waste your money on the shipping that you will have to pay for when you return it as I did.
B000E8THZ2:not_really_good_for_plus_women:rlee	2.0	Nice stretchy material but too short and I'm usually a 16-18.  The G-string is not even close to plus size...don't even bother
B000EJNCYS:item_quality_and_vendor's_customer_service_unsatisfactoy:irene_in_sacramento_"irene"	2.0	The sweatshirt has a cardboard feeling that does not conform to the body. My husband is 6' 178 pounds, so he does not have a problem finding clothes that fit, but this one looked like a stiff kite on him. 
BE AWARE The items were returned and the vendor took over five weeks after receiving the item back to refund the money, and only after I had filed a complaint with Amazon. Amazon acted quickly to post the credit
B0009KPS94:straw_paper:lewis_j._craghead_"lewisjayc"	2.0	First, let me say that I was VERY impressed with the shipping speed of this hat, which was nice because I bought this as a last-minute gift. Though, with that said, there is a BIG difference between straw and straw-paper. This hat is straw-paper. I'm afraid to see what will happen once this hat gets wet from sweat or rain. I really think Amazon should improve this hat's description
B000C7J2CS:not_received:j._cage_"air_force_spouse"	1.0	I guess that I cannot properly review this item, I never received it. This is the second time that I ordered from this same company, Anderson Christian, with almost the same results. The company billed my credit card upon ordering, and then sent one e-mail saying that the items that I ordered are on back order. I eventually cancelled the order. Due to the fact that I live overseas at the moment, I order a lot of things online. I will not be ordering from this company again.
B000KUCFJ4:sizing:b._dietiker_"bdietiker"	2.0	Be careful, this runs REALLY small.  I got the 18-24 for my 14 month old, and it would fit better on an average 6 month old.  Otherwise, it seems of nice quality
B000H86OFK:my_husband's_christmas_present-_sorry_honey_!:barbara_morales	1.0	I bought these slippers as a present for my husband for Christmas. I can't return them  because he wore them for a day. These slippers were so badly made that he is wearing his old slippers. The shape of the sole on the right foot is the same as the left. Don't waste your money
B000B8YZDO:one_size_my_....:miki_trasi	1.0	If your loved one is a beautiful 5'7", 130 lb slender lady like mine, forget about this piece of clothing. If, however, she is a 5'1" 180 lb gorgeous "petite" girl, this might just be the excitement inducer you are looking for. You'll have lots of fun, first trying to put it on her, then trying to use the slits which are in all the wrong places, and then finally to remove it from her body without injuring her or yourself.

Fun that will come after that is purely optional..
B000C9TDIY:defective:vladislav_urshanskiy	1.0	These look and feel good but the little nobs do break off pretty quick, ruining the shoes completely. Do not buy them.
B000C9TDIY:defective_merchandise:c._schulze	1.0	The little knobs in the sole of the sandals started breaking off soon after I got the sandals.  I have had these sandals before and this didn't happen.  Maybe they redesigned the sole with narrower, and thus more fragile, nubs.  All I know is, they are junk
B000E7WK9I:disappointed:sarah_e._white_"sarahgirll"	2.0	I bought these shoes to do aerobics in. They look good and are comfortable, but only to walk in. There is zero arch support and when I walk in them I feel as if my feet are flat on the ground. There is zero shock absorption and no cushion for doing aerobics. My old shoes that are 8 months old has triple the cusion of these new ones, but I can't use the old ones. The gym on the base here do not allow dirty shoes. They are 8 months dirty full of sand and dirt. I am really let down over this as it took me three weeks to have them delivered to my remote location. Now I have to look again
B000JVHM88:not_what_i_expected:hilarie_i._ormsby	1.0	The scarf itched my neck, smelled funny and was not the color of ivory. It was beige. It is not cashmere. It would not itch if it were cashmere
B000F8T60M:looks_good_on_picture_but...:alexander_nevsky	1.0	I had to return it immediately when I opened the box.  On the picture it looks more blue than purple
B0001XHFS6:don't_buy_these_scrubs:c._lehman	1.0	Unfortunately, the pockets are small, the fabric is poor quality, the seams already have started to split after wearing it twice.

Overall poor quality.  I would not recommend these scrubs.  I personally will never buy from this company again.

On a more positive note, they did get the right size and shipped promptly
B000J44HJW:cute_but_not_a_good_fabric:rebecca_woods	2.0	These undies look very cute, but they don't breathe and, well, let's just say that wicking moisture away rather than trapping it is what one should expect in underwear
B000JJNGQW:prada's_throw-up_orange:minerva_kellog_"mk"	1.0	Look, it's on sale! Usually 800.00 now you can get it for only 150.00. And you won't find anyone else wearing this original. Make your drunken friends dizzy with envy. Spill anything on this shirt, it has already has every color in it and no one will notice the spill. Worth every penny. As a bonus, you can also wear this shirt while hunting.
B000KE6VMW:disappointed_in_quality:traci_jones_"ranch_mom"	1.0	I purchased this skin to accompany my daughter's new mp3 player.  We managed to tear the skin first thing out of the box even though we were being careful, or so we thought.  I expected higher durablity
B0002PQEF8:barely_there_is_right!:singer	2.0	I agree with the other review.  I love the tag-free feeling, but that was about all I liked about this bra.

The fabric seems really cheap.  After maybe 6 washings, my Barely There CC Tagfree was feeling flimsy, and the fabric on the outside of the cups started to pill.  For what they charge for even basic bras these days, I definitely expect them to stay in decent shape for longer than a couple months!  I would not buy another one of these unless they significantly improved the fabric.
B0002PQEF8:not_buying_again:kelly04_"kelly_collins"	1.0	Had only 4 wks......poss. washed 2x (and hung dry) and underwire is coming out of side and poking me
B0007Y9OEW:not_what_i_ordered:tamora_l._skelly	1.0	The color that I received and the color that was online was not the same.  I shipped it back.  Had to pay for the shipping and handling and insurance myself.  Tried to resolve through Hungry Lion, but they claimed the color was never shown online, when it was.  Hungry Lion did say I would get a refund on the item.  Still have not checked to see if I have received credit yet. Still waiting for my statement.
B000AS5ED0:terrible_terrible!:s._bezalel	1.0	These slippers are not a bargain. They fall apart within a few months and then you need to buy another pair again. Don't buy 'em. They're junk
B000AS5ED0:no_arch_support!:l._stephens	2.0	I bought these slippers because the description specified arch support but in fact the slippers have none.  In the photo, the sole of the slipper appears to have a raised arch area, however, this turns out to be only a styling effect where the sole wraps the upper -- there's no structure under it at all.  The quality of the slipper's upper is lower than expected, it appears to be entirely sythetic despite the description of "wool-blend".  Also, one of the soles was not glued in properly and fell out after I put my foot in the slipper the first time. The rubber sole is substantial, though heavier than I like to wear in a slipper.  All in all, I regret spending the money on these
B000B8N9QS:not_really_happy_with_scrubs:nick_name	2.0	In general, I don't think much of the manufacture of the scrubs that are sold for medical professionals.  I thought Dickies would be the best, but found they are mostly like the others.  After I received these, I ordered Dove Apparel, which are more expensive but thicker of material and sturdier of make
B0008MF4DS:wife_not_happy:j._caban_"tough__bookworm"	2.0	she said it was not very good and ended up not wearing it at all
B0008MF4DS:terrible!:a._cansino_"new_mommy"	1.0	I bought this from Motherhood and hated it!!! It is too narrow and so puts a lot of pressure on your hips and pelvic bones, which any pregnant lady knows- our bones are already moving and don't need more help!! The mother ez belt was fabulous though!! I wore it for the last 4 months!!!  Forget about this one though!!!
B000CFH0ZQ:this_is_not_gore-tex:vlad_t	2.0	apparently there is an error in the item description. these are not gore-tex and are just about as waterproof as a seive. I new they probably were not waterproof when I put them on and saw my socks through the mesh upper but desided to test them out anyway... stupid me.
B000CFH0ZQ:it_hurts_my_heels:y._wang	1.0	I would not buy this product again.  It hurts my heeles badly because it is so narrow at that end
B0009WE7XA:purchase_never_received:joayna_r._sirolli	1.0	The item is not my concern; I still have not even received it
B0002OQV70:this_product_is_typical_in_that_it_has_a_tight_waist_band.:robert_g._reoch	1.0	I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.
B000HVYPH6:waste_of_money:mary_"mary"	1.0	VERY, VERY, WEIRD fit. Too short, too wide, tiny ankles, very big and loose above ankle
B000GGQDQI:way_too_small:willgolf4fun	1.0	I ORDERED A LARGE AND ASSUMED IT WAS ADULT SIZE...THIS LARGE WAS LIKE A GIRLS SIZE LARGE....VERY SMALL SIZING  I RETURNED THE SWEATER..
B000BWDTIM:not_recommended:kevin_brislin	1.0	I bought these shoes and they only lasted four months. The leather sole was REALLY slippery and never did make it easy to walk with them on. By the last month i had them, the sole had totally separated from the upper. I thought Florsheim shoes were good; maybe years ago, but not now. These shoes are NOT recommended at all
B000BWDTIM:florsheim_men's_victor_slip-on,_black,_7.5_eee:hiep_v_tran_"hoangphi"	1.0	I am so disappointed.  Its with is narrower than stated but its lenghth is longer than stated around 1 size
B000BWDTIM:arrived_unglued_&_were_immediately_returned:darin_hoover	1.0	Don't buy these.  I used to love Florsheim (I still wear an old pair of Comfortech's) but I got a bad pair of these
B00064CI5A:strange_looking_visor:summer_lover_"patty"	1.0	This visor is square in shape instead of oval, I have never seen a square visor before. It looks very strange.  Also, it is not comfortable as it is supposed to be, it is uncomfortable at the location where the sides hug to my head.  I will not be wearing mine
B000EBBXYC:very_narrow:s._deverter	2.0	I bought this shoe and had to return it because it was so narrow I couldn't get it on and I don't have a narrow foot
B000LVAUQ2:disappointing_for_crocs:s._l._eaton_"historyfan29"	1.0	I love all other Crocs styles, but was very disappointed in the Prima.  They are too slim, and look odd and stretched out on me.  They also tend to slip off in the back as I walk, yet the other styles fit me perfectly.  Great idea, but they should have worked on it more.  I can't wear these outside the house
B00068B7BW:foam_lacking:james_j._odonnell	1.0	The foam padding does not have enough consistancy. It stays compressed with in a short period of time. 
Not recommended
B000AFDDI6:wrong_size:j._sawyer	1.0	Ordered large, got "youth large", too small. Threw out receipt before checking. My bad. wife now wears T-shirt to work out in
B0001IA06U:terrible_bra:m._cardenas_"breastfeeding_mama"	1.0	Ok, for some reason my first review was never posted which only makes me more upset about this bra!  This bra is useless for me.  It has snaps instead of clasp which make it a two handed job to open and close, not so great for public nursing.  And, for someone who is a 34-36 B-C it is amazing to me when the bra slides out of place, the nursing pads fall out and my bed becomes soaked with middle of the night leakage!  All and all I would not recommend this bra
B000MN0O24:broken:thomas_m._vaughan	1.0	Used the jump rope maybe 3-4 times and the handle broke off, you would expect a quality jump rope for the price but don't count on it. Then again it could have just been mine
B000GA99EW:too_sheer,_too_small:momma_2_be	2.0	Sorry, there is no way this shirt is supposed to last even your first five months...runs too small and was completely to thin/sheer.  Can be seen straight through
B0000AFSU4:overcharged_on_order:chris_l.a.cal	1.0	My original order was 1 pair of tennis shoes missing so when I had to re-order the 2nd pair of identical tennis shoes, I was overcharged & also had to pay shipping fees again. I tried several times to resolve this problem via Amazon & the shipping co. Bealls Florida, but was basically ignored & never received my refund. I find this to be deceitful & poor customer service
B000FQC7HS:comfortable_but_smelly!:kaijen	1.0	I was so happy when I found these shoes, they are cute and comfortable, exactly what I was looking for. BUT after about two weeks of wearing them, always with socks or pantyhose, they started to smell terrible. I don't have this problem with any of my other shoes. This was SO disappointing, I will either try to return them or just trash them.
B000AR9SI8:boots_shipped_did_not_look_the_same_as_on_website:lee_price_"lee4956"	1.0	I ordered a pair of the adult designer rain boots from Diane's Little Lambs. I specifically ordered because the boots appeared to accommodate a wider calf (were shorter, fuller, etc). But the boots that arrived were taller, even the color was not the same as 
on the website. I emailed the vendor, never got a reply. So I went to the website to get instructions on mailing the boots back.
B000CQSW6G:not_so_comfortable:kristina_r._behn	1.0	The shoe is too narrow and the sides dig into my feet.  The sole of the shoe makes it feel like you are off balance.  I have narrow feet but the structure of this shoe does not lend itself to a comfortable wear at all.
B000BOLS0G:good_idea,_bad_execution:domer	1.0	This tie winder is not only twice the size I was expecting, but it doesn't work.  After one attempted use, the lid no longer stays on.  I would have returned it if the return shipping didn't cost more than the item
B0009PHLOO:looks_good_but_breaks_easy_:c._combs_"13_shygurl_13"	1.0	I got these for christmas in 06 and they looked great on me. Last week I took them to school and I put them in the small pouch of my backpack and at then at the end of the day i took them out at on of the sides had completley snaped in half.There was no way to repair them. These glasses look good but dont waste your money on these. Really cheap. I am very unhappy. =(
B0009PHLOO:not_to_happy:miranda_lamb_"mariah"	1.0	Well i am a big sunglass fan. i just love them so i was excited to get these. they seemed very cute. well when i got them the lenses were scratched and there was stuff on the sides of the glasses. this was my first purchase from this seller and honestly i dont think i will ever buy from them again
B000GTSHLE:did_not_work_for_me:erin_kerwin	1.0	Unfortunately the pads made my skin break out and gave me a painful rash.  I think that if they work for you, they would be wonderful, but if you have sensitive skin, they are not for you.  I love the idea. I am a leaky faucet and I would love an easy breast pad that worked.  I am sick of sleeping with my bra on. Hopefully by the time I have my next child, they will come up with something even more breathable
B0002EPU7W:not_so_great_socks:ponyrcr	1.0	I bought these socks to wear for work.  They didn't even last one day.  By the end of the first day, there was a hole in one of the socks at my heal.  By the end of the week both socks had quarter sized holes at the heels.  I bought three pairs so I tossed out the first pair.

The next week I put on a new pair of socks, and once again by the end of the day there was a quarter sized hole in one of the heels.
B000EXV1IS:a_damn_shame:jane_lane™_"a_lavish_ravishment"	2.0	.............they sent me the wrong size...and didn't leave clear returning guidelines. You are better off getting something cheaper, because this sure as hell wasnt worth the buck
B000I2Z3C0:look_like_elf_shoes:untitled	2.0	This shoes are uncomfortable and make your feet look wide.  They run small.  They look nicer in the picture than they actually are
B0002V2YI8:attractive,but_do_not_wear_well:lori_l._graham_"yose"	2.0	I wore these socks once to a wedding; they had a "run" in them within a couple of hours. Admittedly it was an outdoor wedding, involving a longish walk on a dirt road, but it's not as if I was crashing through the underbrush (I was wearing a nice outfit and had no desire to get messed up). Bummer the socks got ruined so fast; they were really pretty :-(
B0007P9374:not_water_proof:peggy_j._baillie_"d._baillie"	2.0	This jacket is wind and water resistant, but not waterproof.  I was soked through after first rain. I use it mainly for wind block while biking now
B0009PX20G:mike,_you_can_kiss_my_multi_colored_behind!!:alfredia_darden	1.0	Mail Fraud,I believe its called!! texas shirt company if this is a real company never had this item to sell. I'm surprise Amazon.com is even associating with them..and mike to get this bent out of shape over a $12 dollar item you need to see someone to address your anger issues.
B0008172YS:not_that_good:r._welch_"mom_in_texas"	1.0	This product is not what it is cracked up to be.  I ordered it, and it doesn't really work too well, i think a button with a piece of elastic would be better.  There is not enough expansion room , its just like not really using anything at all.  Sorry, but i thought the product was not that good.
B0008172YS:wonder_button,_collar_expander,_extender:janet_lundgren	1.0	I did not like this product at all. It is very hard to use and  too small
B000BGSAZU:deceived_by_looks..:a._p._sakharpe_"aashs"	1.0	1. Packaging was shabby.
2. The finishing was pathetic with threads hanging out.
3. The quality and feel of the cloth was the worst I have ever seen.
4. DONT be deceived by the pictures.
5. The end product is not worth a gift or personal use nor 25% of the actual cost
B000GDKV8C:don't_bother:a._neel	2.0	A sports bra is supposed to keep the jiggling in check when you exercise, but this one doesn't.  Also, the construction leaves something to be desired.  It's very scratchy around the back of the straps and the hooks, where the seams are sewn.  I bought two.  After trying them several times, I gave up and sent them to charity.  Don't bother
B0006TP0TG:natori_bra:tptrz_"sadi"	1.0	I found this bra to be not as supportive as they claim. Still alot of bounce when exercising and the material seem to be to stretchy so the longer it's worn the more it loses shape. The shoulder straps I didn't find had enough support hooks for lift up. I personally wouldn't recommend this bra
B000AQUGGC:what_do_these_sizes_mean?:j._estep_"j._estep"	1.0	Are customers to guess what is a "small" size compared to a "large size?" Is the small for a todder, pre-schooler or teenager? What a waste of time trying to find information on this web-site about the sizes.
B000AQUGGC:i_want_to_know_also.:nana_rose	1.0	Cannot order these as they do not say what small, medium or large=....I have a 6 year olde and is 60#'s so do I buy a medium or a large...I hate this when I want  something and there is not enough information..
B000AQUGGC:would_be_nice_to_know_what_the_sizes_represent_in_numbers:s.h.	2.0	Would love to order these, but sizes are not clear.  Does small fit a toddler, is small a size 7?  Not sure how to order.
B000EORB4K:disappointed...:babs	2.0	I bought this a size smaller than I thought I needed, but maybe I would be happier with it if I had bought it 2 sizes smaller.  I really don't see how the material this is made out of can have any kind of "firm control".  Sure, it's comfortable, but I was expecting some kind of control.  It does smooth out some, but not at all what I was expecting..
B000BNSHNS:picture_is_inaccurate:andrea_m._kimmel_"andrea_kimmel"	1.0	In the picture it shows of this bra it looked as if it was low cut and comfortable, but it shows it in a smaller size than the one I wear, so once I opened the box I was very suprised that it was so huge and cumbersome. It could not possibly be worn with a low cut top, which is why I bought it. If you were a size 34d or above, beware
B0006V5CO2:quality_lacking:sean_l._craft_"crafty"	2.0	This jacket is soft and almost luxurious.  I am greatly disappointed that when hanging the hoodie by the hood, it split and tore under its own weight!!!!  I think this says it all, no?  I would, unfortunately, not buy and American Apparel item again.  They are usually sized WAY too small and now I see the quality just isn't there.  Greener pastures.....
B000EU0JMK:nice_look,_poor_fit:cw_"cw"	2.0	Perhaps a pediatrist who knows better designed this shoe's insert, but I hated it. It felt half-there. There was good cushion at the back and felt like none at the front - like those "orthotic" deals that come on infomercials. Well, it didn't feel good on my tender forefoot so I sent them back.

On the other hand, the shoe looked great. I guess, if you really want it, shoe can go shopping for some Dr. Scholl's
B0009QWPJY:not_much_fun_to_wear:tokyo_mum	1.0	This cardigan doesnt have proper buttonholes just cut slits that are both ugly and will not last long. The texture went bobbly after one day near the arms
B000E4AG4W:buy_at_your_own_risk:brooke_"turtle"	1.0	These would be great boots if you had some way of knowing what size to order.  I emailed Western Chief for a size chart.  I then ordered my son's boots according to the size chart Western Chief sent me.  Once I received the boots I was upset to see that the boots were over 1 inch larger than the size chart showed - this is a big deal for a child's boot.  I then called Western Chief and explained the situation and asked to get an actual measurement of a few other sizes so I could order the correct boots.  I spoke with a Ms. Brewer, who was rather rude, she told me she would have to go to the warehouse to measure the boots and she would call me back.  Of course that was a week ago.  
I luckily found very similar boots at Target - problem solved.
How could a company have a shoe size chart that is so wrong?  The bad customer service was just the cherry on top  :
B000AL59ZK:jewelry_roll_by_lewis_n._clark:ann_bost_"ancwisdom"	1.0	The item was not as pictured.  It is funky and of poor quality.  The seller did not respond when I contacted him about this
B000H40TWI:sooooo_disappointed:nicole_moyer_"nicole"	1.0	I love Nine West shoes, but these boots are not made like Nine West.
It didn't help that when I received them they were damaged. I purchased 3 other pairs of Nine West shoes from Amazon and LOVE them but these boots stink!!
B000H8FMX0:value:jack	2.0	For all the costs involved in purchasing the Jedi Robe it was'nt worth it.
Shipping/handling and customs charge were not worth purchasing the item.  I will never shop Amazon or any online store
B000FKDFF2:i_lost_my_money:o._leon	1.0	I received my sunglasses last week, they are increibles but they arrived in deficient conditions. they have three lines on them, and simply I feel that I lost my money.  I think that you should pay attention to the way eyeglasses are packed for transportatio
B000HC5N3A:live_up_to_promise:t._erickson	2.0	The collar stays work as the ad indicates they will.  They are organized and packaged well.  The sizes provided accomodate all collars
B000EQAB68:do_not_buy:barbara_b._fisher_"working_against_the_tide."	2.0	I have done a review on these socks already, which has not appeared.  They are not a good buy
B000ERK47I:rips_at_the_seems:joseph_c._hansen_"vw151"	1.0	This shoe is very comfortable, unfortunately I had to send it back to the manufacturer twice, the second time choosing a different style shoe because the net material comes loose from the seems where the laces are. I am very dissapointed as I have come to expect quality from Merrell and these shoes fall apart in a few weeks.  I would recommend a different shoe as this one will last you between 1 and 3 weeks before ripping
B0000722QI:not_worth_the_price:jvputten_"jvputten"	2.0	I've owned a pair of 587s for 18 months, wearing them exclusively as walking shoes full-time in the summer and very little the rest of the year. While the shoes are comfortable, I was disappointed at how fast they're falling apart. The padding around the ankle has torn, there are small holes in the top of the toe box from my big toes, and I was surprised to see the description of these shoes on this website to include the statement, "The solid rubber outsole delivers long-wearing durability." That's been my major complaint with these shoes; shortly after I got them, the soles cracked at the heel, and now layers of the soles are peeling off.

I recommend buying another model..
B0001452V2:sizing_wrong:p._bell	2.0	I like how smooth it is under t-shirts but the size is out. I ordered my usual 34B but found it too small. 34B fits in other brands so I know it's not because I've got bigger
B00009ET0W:too_large_-_didn't_like:jeanne_allen_"jinx_pacific"	1.0	These two packets of panties were too large.  I also didn't like the cotton.  Since I had opened one packet of three I kept it, but  I sent the unopened packet of 3 back because I didn't like them.

B000CF42WA:the_soles_split_after_one_month:scott_w._binder	1.0	I was not pleased with these.  I bought mine at Target, and within one month the soles of both sandals were cracked.  No refund, since they were used.
B0007XS0U2:it_didn't_work_for_me:athair	1.0	Maybe I'm naive, but I never could figure out how the hooks came out of the keycase. They are spring-loaded, and they turn. A certain combination of push or twist or pull seems necessary to get them out. I got one out by sheer accident but that is it. And there are no directions included. So I'm back to a keyring and that's not so bad.
B000ACDIES:seller_has_no_exchange_policy:cherie_m._cooper_"coop41@sisna.com"	2.0	Ordered shoe in my usual size; shoe was too tight.  Bealls does not have an exchange policy whereby they will ship a different size at no charge; so I returned the shoes and got credit for the purchase, but not for shipping both ways
B000CRYY8U:sizes_are_cut_small:d._drew	2.0	The shirt is of ok quality but the design is hard to see and will probaby wash off quickly.  Be sure to order a size bigger than you normally would as it is cut small.  Also my personal opinion is the shipping charge for this very light item is a little excessive
B0007IQF5Y:it_was_not_user_friendly_and_then_it_broke!:b._sanchez_"bsama"	1.0	I broke and chipped most of my short fingernails trying to unlock where the keys are suppose to go. Once I got the keys on the holders the zipper broke. I threw it away, but had to scape up my nails again to get my keys off the holders
B0007IQF5Y:cheap!_but_still_useable:misseemonkee	2.0	Cheap! but still useable. Inside had a stained piece of paper/cardboard?... Flimsy leather. Not recommended
B0001ZO4VU:still_a_wedgie:tony_"sfsportsjock"	1.0	This is not a jockstrap.  It is a thong and is inappropriate for any sporting activity.  I tried wearing it as regular underwear but found it incredibly uncomfortable, let alone not exactly hygenic!  No surprise that they are phasing them out of their lineup.  Probably the only uncomfortable underwear made by RIPS
B0002ZQUAW:terrible!:astelia_campos_"astelia"	1.0	The corset looks so pretty... its a pretty material... It can hold you YES... it has a boning made of some crappy material... after wearing it I noticed something was poking Me... both ends the top and the bottom... well when I take a look it looks like the type of thing guys use to fish line. 
It hurted so bad... so I tried to "snip" it with some nail clippers.. they just keep on coming and coming... it totally sucks.. now I cant even use it without thinking of a painful experience
B0002ZQUAW:me_too:gary_bingaman	2.0	I was getting some boning too but didnt mind.  This ensemble is a lot of fun to wear once its broken in.  I wear mine all the time
B000JNJTNW:from_portugal_to_china:bifford_"bifford"	2.0	I have owned several pairs of this very boot since 1990; and the first two pairs lasted many years through winter, spring and fall. Each boot used top quality leather and Vibram soles. I actually had the soles replaced on the second pair as they became worn out before the leather upper portion of the boot. Both pairs were very comfortable and durable, with a look all to their own.

My third pair, which was recently purchased, were not of the same quality of the prior pairs of boots. The leather was stiff and upon wearing them the first time the top lacing hook pulled out as I began to snug up the laces. The backer on the riveted lacing hook was defective from the factory. 

Not being satisfied with the quality of the new boots, I sent them back. I did notice the country of manufacture was different on the later pair than the previous pairs. Made in Portugal to made in China... the quality has been degridated and am disappointed in Rockport.
B000JNJTNW:rockport_sizes_not_normal:david_e._schaeffer	2.0	I bought one pair of shoes and returned them, they were to large. Bought another pair and hoped that I would adjust to the shoe, I haven"t. I have worn the shoes now and can not return them. I plan to give them away to someone they may fit. I will never order shoes again, I learned my lesson.I agree with the other review good quality in the manufacturing poor design as far as the size.I believe rockport made a mistake with the size and fit and thats why they are being sold for a discounted price. I will go to a shoe depatment and try on the shoes before I buy, as I have in the past
B000JNJTNW:disappointed_brat:stephen_c._smith_"chosen_by_god"	2.0	Boots are very, very, dark brown, look nothing like the picture, fit poorly, an item that has to be fitted before purchasing

B000627GOK:not_impressed:all_of_outdoors	1.0	I ordered this item on September 10, 2006.  As of January 12, 2007 I have still not received the ordered item but the pictures of it sure are nice.  One star is one star too many
B000OEZM32:cheap_knockoff_-_not_genuine_item:david_m._adams	1.0	This was NOT the apple armband they advertised, it was a cheap foreign knockoff - I wish I had never bought it. Terrible misrepresentation of sold item. Buyer beware!!
B000NX06JE:not_impressive,_rather_disapointing.:r._j._munoz_"riverstone"	1.0	I recieved this item yesterday.  Initaly I was very happy, it changed my 8GB black ipod into a green ipod and did a rather good job of it.  The inner skin is a clear white-ish frosted color allowing the original ipod color to show through, I would have preferred an opaque white, but it did not look terribly bad with the green, though blue, red, or any other color than green would have been better with the black I had not the inital foresight to picture this. I was still pretty happy at this point. The hip-clip was removed right away, I have been looking for a nano cover that would allow me to dock to my Logitech MM50 (portable speaker)  without taking it out of the case, eureka, this case did that, without the clip of course.  The lanyard was an added bonus until earlier today I discovered the clips that held the lanyard in place had widened the aperature connections on the iPod nano, so that I would never trust it on the lanyard for fear it would fall off and be lost.  Well, I was still happy with the color change and the ability to sit in my portable speakers without taking it off. Unitl, I discovered a surface scratch on the green coloring of the case. Now, despite the fact that this is the "Aluminum" iSkin Duo, this was not the case at all.  The green metalic colored plastic is painted with an aluminum look.  Okay that was still acceptable, until, I discovered what looked to be a surface layer peeling off, sugesting that eventualy the color would flake away. That was it, that was the broke back camel inducement, and now I am the proud owner of a case that I will never be happy with. At first I had been all excited, and was considering the purchase of other colors, not now, this in my consideration was a waste of money. Hopefully I'll confirm that my ipod can still link to the cradle inspite of the clip damage the lanyard has done.

B000FK17FM:do_not_buy_this:j._atkinson_"jo_knows"	1.0	This robe virtually fell apart when I washed it.  It stained the inside of my washing machine.  It raveled before I even got a chance to wear it.  Do not buy this product.  I got the burgandy one.  I am so disappointed by this product I may stop shopping at Amazon
B000FK17FM:quality(plush?)of_hooded_terry_bathrobe:r._hartman	2.0	Very ordinary robe compared to picture and descripton. If plush means thick material this is not. It is low quality thin material with a warning to wash in cold.Any terry robe I have had before was thicker and better made--Sears, J.C. Penney.Does not llook durable
B000BJV6US:not_for_short_women:rhonda_l._newhall	2.0	These pants did not look good on me.  They seem built for thin people.  While not obese, I am not a stick figure either and these just did not flatter me.  The material is nice, though
B000E7ZW6G:should_not_be_classified_as_"walking_shoes":#1_ann_rule_fan_"terri"	1.0	I purchased these shoes when I started working on a job that required walking almost the entire shift.  My feet are killing me, after working for almost a month.  There is no cushioning in them, nor much arch support

B00006X8W0:horrible_pant-horrible_service:tammy_schmitt_"voleeballfanatic"	1.0	I purchased these for my fiance to wear for our beach wedding in Puerto Rico.  The quality is horrendous, the cut is for MC Hammer not real men, and the company charged me over $22.00 to ship them to me and then told me I wanted them Fed EX.  Not true, the pants were returned, the rest of my order cancelled and I will never purchase anything from this company again
B0001EKNWU:2_sizes_smaller_than_size_specified:ivan_vadenev_"ivan"	2.0	This item is about two sizes smaller than the size you order. I ordered a size 9, but wasn't able to wear them. I gave them to my little brother who's a size 7, they fit him perfectly
B0007Z2MNG:horible!:lisa_i._johns	1.0	Do not waist your money on this item! It looks so unnatural. The padding is only on the side of the butt cheeks, doesnt cover the whole butt so you can definitly detect the padding. I was so disapointed when I tried it on.
B0007Z2MNG:a_complete_and_utter__waste_of_money:pn_mckoy	1.0	i recently purchase ''Better Bottom Padded Panties'...l was really disappointed.Like most women i always wish i had  a bigger and more curvy bottom but was really disappointed when it arrived. the padding was made of cheap foam material and it was very visible under clothing even denim...ladies please dont waste your money. iam really gutted because i bought some new trosers and i was hoping to wear the padded panties underneath it
B000M3I0ZC:i_will_be_returning_this_item:mimi_and_me_"frequent_amazon_convenience_shopper"	1.0	I will be returning this item to the vendor.  I rec'd. this skirt for my daughter and thought it had a colorful embroidery.  Instead I find the word BASKE in a mirrored embroidered image.  Not sure what BASKE stands for.  I guess it's their idea of 'short for Basketball'.  WHATEVER!  You can't see the pic clearly.  I'm out the shipping cost on this one.  What a bummer!
B000FL18AK:stylish_jacket_made_of_bad_material:gregg	1.0	Thinking this jacket was made of fleece like material, i ordered it thinking it was a good buy. When i got it in the mail, a week later, i was soooooooooo disappointed. The material is like paper/ potato sack material... Its awful.. Like plastic...  I dont recommend u waste [...] on this .. The jacket is stylish no doubt... but the material not something u'd actually wear.. So a stylish jacket with bad material describes this jacket best. [...
B000FL18AK:a_paper_bag...:t._gage	2.0	While I was a little wary of ordering a jacket for $20 online, I went ahead and ordered this one. It seemed like it was made of durable material, and looked snazzy. When it came in the mail today, it was stuffed in a first class envelope with another t-shirt [which I really like!]. I was anxious to see what it was like.

This jacket is /literally/ made of the material used for FedEx envelopes. Sounds cool, huh? The jacket is extremely thin, and feels like you're wearing a paper bag. While I appreciate the prompt service of the people at Andrew Christian, they will probably see my jacket returned within the next couple of weeks
B0000867DC:super_duper_huge:jake's_mom	1.0	I have Goddess bras, and it seems that each style has it's own sizing.  The love at first sight bra fits wonderfully, while this bra is about 3 cup sizes larger than what it is supposed to be
B000E7MZGG:tight_fit,_lining_is_poor.:john_f._panarelli_"old_amazoner"	2.0	The jacket is cut undersized, typical of foreign makes with poor quality control. The lining in the sleeve keeps coming ot at the wrist which interferes with activity. Exterior shell has nice feel, but overall, a poor piece of work
B0007VVYKM:complete_rip-off:dls_"james'mother"	1.0	Very disappointing.  This product has less control than an average pair of pantyhose.  The "high waist" was always rolling down.  I wasn't expecting miracles; I just wanted to smooth out my silouette while I lost the final ten pounds of pregnancy weight.  This product was completely useless.  Product has a clever name but that's it.  I really felt like a sucker for spending so much money on this item.  Look elsewhere.
B000B85LMI:not_worth_the_money:whitewave	1.0	This shoe is cut right underneath the ankle. Everytime you walk the edge of the shoe rubs into your ankle and causes extreme discomfort and blisters.
B000NDTKUA:item_send_was_not_new:drew_scales	1.0	Item send was not new. Obvious that it had been worn befoe paint on zipper had worn of from use. Also a rip in the design
B000FBRVF6:me's_rumbil_lace-up:jeremy_burger	2.0	I bought this shoe expecting to wear it as a work shoe on occasion, however, the shape of the shoe is very narrow and it doesn't seem to go with anything including jeans. The comfort level is ok, not spectacular. In reality I don't think this shoe lives up to the Steve Madden name. I can't recommend this shoe
B000EXPYPE:vibram_sole_marks_like_crazy:sf_sunset	2.0	The Vibram soles leave black streaks all over the floors, and make it so I cannot wear them at work.  I love Rockports in general, and these are comfortable and well made as expected, but they leave a trail of scuff marks
B000ML9MZQ:eh...:devon_"d-vo"	2.0	Amazon didn't tell any outright lies about this product but they certainly weren't what I expected.  I was expecting something a bit more durable...the first night I tried to sleep in these, they ripped in the back.  The immitation-satin is so thin that it can barely hold itself together.  But I can't give them 1 star because they are just as cute as they look!
B000FHD8YS:not_what_i_was_waiting_for:yohanna_segarra_"yohanna"	1.0	All boot is made with mademan materials. Then they are not as comfortable as I want. With the same amount you can find a better option
B0009R3HB8:poor_quality,_cheaply_made.:k._burlingame_"kitten"	1.0	We purchased these boots for my husband who works in the construction field(mainly insulation instalation) which requires him to climb in high places, walk on trusses, and also be under floors sometimes in standing water and other harsh weather conditions. In my opinion these boots DO NOT have "heavy duty" rubber soles at all but cheap soles that start to rub and crumble almost immediately under working conditions. There is also no arch or foot support inside the boot itself. There is a piece of leather saying "Made in China" and that's it. The tag even reccomends getting some sort of insole. The worst part is that on the tag of the boot it states that you should get the next size up than what your normal boot size is. The seller did not state this fact. All in all, if you are purchasing these boots for long term wear or work related activities I DO NOT reccomend them. If they are for a teenager making a fashion statement or for a Halloween costume they're perfect
B0002A6VU6:do_not_order_from_andrew_christian:j._huber	1.0	We ordered this pea coat from Andrew Christian.  The coat- which is double-breasted- had no inside buttons. You have to have inside buttons to hold the coat evenly. I sent it back as defective.  They were very immovable as to refunding shipping costs to me and then back to them- which amounted to $26.23.  They insisted that it was not defective.  I called five other places that had pea coats and they all had inside buttons. Not reliable and not good to work with.
B000I25HDA:don't_bye!:m._lundström	1.0	Don't bye thees. They don't look like orginals. They are really small, so it looks like glasses for children!!

B000EBVSGK:too_small!:tct	2.0	I would definitely recommend getting a size AND width larger, as these fit very snuggly
B0002OQV7U:this_product_is_typical_in_that_it_has_a_tight_waist_band.:robert_g._reoch	1.0	I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.
B000B67F5G:didn't_fit_well_and_i_was_allergic_to_the_adhesive:tigress_"music,_movie_&_book_goddess"	2.0	Like I said, they didn't fit well and I was allergic to the adhesive. :
B000LRJXZ0:burned_out_on_the_first_use:thomas_r._holmes	1.0	Never charged a thing.  I bought it to use on international travel. It stated that it could be used on 220 and it burnout out shortly after being plugged in
B000FBWYIU:made_in_china_and_taiwan.___:bill	1.0	I am ex US Army, National Guard and Army Reserve.  I did not expect to receive dress web belts made in China and Taiwan from an Army Navy store.  I have other belts made in USA that are heavier materials (belt and buckle).  The belts have lasted 10 to 12 years and the buckles are still good as new!  I ordered 3 belts with buckles thinking I would not need to buy a new belt for the rest of my life.  The web material is very thin for a belt.  The buckles 2 out of 3 are stamped made in Taiwan and the 3rd has a sticker says made in China.  They are cheaply made and are likely to break or snag clothing.  I will not recommend this product to anybody.  After shipping this junk cost me $47.00 !
B000M8P7OO:poor_quality:chandana_wanigasekera_"cricket_lover"	1.0	Poor quality, belts do not fit correctly, can not be returned because it is swimwear according to policy.
Don't trust Skinny Dip Swimwear
B000BNKO1G:these_shoes_are_loud!:j._faidley	2.0	I did realize that these shoes squeaked, but I didn't anticipate how loudly that squeak would be! I doubt my girls could hear anything over the sound their shoes were making- I know I couldn't
B000HW9BVK:don't__do_it:dr._samer_k._zawaideh	1.0	I bought this item, and was very disappointed when I received it and tried it on. The mock crocodile leather looks very cheap...the "leather" of the shoe is very hard and I could not wear it for more than 4 hours since it was cutting on the sides of my feet.. After which I threw the shoe in the trash....it was such a waste of money...do not think of buying it..
B0002FHIXA:poor_fit:great_faulkner's_ghost	2.0	Like all the Haynes T-shirts except the 50/50, these bunch at the back of the neck. Try another brand
B0002OQV7A:this_product_is_typical_in_that_it_has_a_tight_waist_band.:robert_g._reoch	1.0	I am in great shape.  However, I cannot get over that so many men's underwear products have waist bands that constrict and exasperarate blood flow and muscle tension.  Obviously they are made in China where the average waist is about 25 inches.  

The idea of "Medium" as marketed is ridiculous by healthy American standards.  My body fat is low.  I am not profoundly muscular bound. As is common in men of my age, lower back problems are not unusual. I have a 32" waist.  Is that not "Medium" sized? 

I think we simply need to get rid of the elastic waist band altogether.  One size fits all doesn't work and it is dangerous to those many of us that fight our lower back problems.  

The draw string is fine.  It allows flexibility.  So what if your pants fall down?  It seems to be the fashion, anyway.  Just give us the option of pulling the shorts back up instead of pinching nerves with a static elastic waist band that causes ridiculous lower back problems because of unnecessary, uncontrollable constrictions.  

Also, these boxers don't hold up well to any kind of washing.  They looked like crap after the first time I washed them.

I wish I could get a refund because I won't wear them again.  My life partner told me they looked like "old men's" underwear. That is sad and embarrassing because I agree they looked like crap after one cold wash and light dry.

I am not a mean hearted kind of guy.  So, I am going to shut my mouth now and not do business with you again.
B0002CSI5U:comes_to_high_on_the_belly.:martin_newmark_"amazon_review@cogneodesigns.com"	1.0	The shorts I bought came way over my belly button. Made me look like a funky old man. I returned them. Otherwise the sizing was good.
B0006I9QMO:good_product,_very_bad_vender:j._wang_"quality_man"	2.0	The iPod Mini Case self is very good from Pacific Design. But Amazon made a mistake to choose eBags as their supplier.

I have ordered one iPod and one iPod Mini cases for my friend's daughters as a Christmas gift. The iPod case was shipped from Amazon directly, as usual, it was nice packed and fast shipping. The other iPod Mini was shipped from eBags. It was bad, bad and bad. I won't order anything from eBags any more. Here is why:

- It was almost one week later than Amazon's shipment.
- It was an open, unpacked or returned item.
- Amazon charges the shipping for that item, even you qualify for the free shipping on your order.

If you don't care about all of these, please go ahead and good luck. I gave 2 stars is because of the product self, otherwise I would give none
B0002UCERU:don't_buy_this_product:y._ismail	1.0	It's awful. the S size is too big for me (My waistline is 34 and in the sizing chart it says "size S fits 26-36")so i end up cut it and sew it back so it can fit on me. Then after 3 days of wearing it, the velcro is messed up, it can not attached together anymore. The costumer service is an answering machine (I tried several times to call the costumer service, and only get the machine answer my call). I can not return the item, because it says its illegal to return this kind of item. So my advise, dont buy this item or you'll be sorry.
B000BU5PAO:an_amusing_hat,_but_be_informed...:everett_hall	2.0	Judging from the picture, I thought this thing looked like a turban!  It actually has no wrapped fabric, but is a firmly fitting cap.  Hidden in the back is an elastic band that will adjust for larger heads, which is attached to the edges of an ugly looking triangular gap.  Aside from this, the coloring is too bold.  Old Glory will select random coloration for each customer, but my selection has over twice the color variety as the one in the picture!  I don't see how I can wear it without attracting stares
B000GZYXPW:cut_is_defective_-_sleeves_run_extra_long.:christina_"christina"	1.0	This suit fits like a true Italian size - I ordered a 54 which equals a US 44 approximately. It fit my husband perfectly excaept while the entire suit is cut as a size Regular length and the sizing indicates they are not longs or otherwise, the sleevs ran over 2 inches longer than a regular should, even though the body length was normal for a regular. I think these suits are defects/rejects in which the sleevs were cut too long. So I would not recommend it unless you need a long size in sleeves
B000L3PF1U:not_comfortable_for_workout:cs	2.0	This is definitely not something I would want to wear while working out.  Even with mild exercise the lining feels sticky, and the fabric does not appear to breathe.  I'd rather wear cotton jersey pants than this.  For cooler weather, I'd prefer something like a good pair of tights (Sugoi for example)
B000GF4CJE:cheaply_made:rachelle_cook	2.0	Very dissapointed in this outfit, looks really nice in pictures but is very cheaply made frayed the first time put on.
B000AMCGK0:love_victorinox_but_this_bag_had_issues._:g._miller_"madlinux.com"	2.0	I love that little white cross on red and normally expect a quality product when I buy them. 
I had this bag for about 2 months of daily use before the two serious failures appeared.
In two locations on the bag the nylon came unstitched: One hole along one of the side panels and the other under the handle. 
It would appear to me that the inside portion of the nylon wasn't properly sealed/Melted together to prevent the material from becoming unwoven. 
The handle came about half-way separated from it before I stopped using it. 

This is a really disappointing thing for me because in the age of globalization, quality always loses to low price and there seems to be fewer and fewer opportunities to buy really quality products without fear that it is crap with a high pricetag. 

I would advise Victorinox to pay attention to quality assurance before people abandon their products as overpriced junk products by a company who has sold out quality for price. 

Some of us are ready and willing to pay a higher price for a quality product.
B000JSRPQA:this_needs_a_bra:k._epps	2.0	I loved the concept of this item, but it didn't live up to my expectations.  The top was extremely loose in the bra portion and provided no support.  The pants, however, were comfortable and I really loved them.  

The top needs to be reworked
B0006IKYNE:built_up_camisole:barbara_george_"caretaker_of_hearts"	2.0	This camisole did not fit my purpose. The idea is great, but it didn't fit me correctl
B0007V3HIE:eck!!!:julia_d._whiting	1.0	I ordered this dress and when I received it, I thought that it was very pretty.  When I put the dress on, it was completely see through.  You could see my bandaid on my thigh.  I would not suggest this dress for anyone based soley on the material.
It's a shame because they dress is very flattering and also comfortable.
It would also be impossible to wear anything under this dress (including pasties) because it seemed to show everything
B000GC1ZDI:not_what_i_thought._:janice_montelione	2.0	I have white everlast boxing shoes & they are very comfortable & I thought these ones were the same. the difference is that the other ones have soft parts in it where the feet move when boxing. 
 The black ones are uncomfortable in the back side where the division of the shoe is.  They don't move well. 
 plus they charged almost $ 20. for shipping. so I ended up paying a lot for them.
B0007LXT8W:functional:the_delightful_one_"well_read"	2.0	a)the quality is not that great. 
b)the socks are not skid proof. 
BUT
its good to have 8 pairs because somehow the curse of missing socks will hit babies socks too. sometimes they pull them off while takig a walk, at restaraunts, friends' homes, and sometimes the dryer eats them.:
B000GFICCW:red_sox_pink_hoody_sweatshirt:james_f._armstrong_"jim"	1.0	A good product and a good fit.  Wish the logo had been a little bigger
B0000A9DG1:crummy_front_closure!:buffalo_girl	2.0	When I move around, I sure don't need a front closure that comes undone... many times a day?!  The hook on this bra needs to be changed to a snap closure!
Perfect bra in every other sense, but a self unhooking bra?  No good
B000LNOYBM:review_on_acu_polar_fleece_cap:m._hecker_"armygirl"	2.0	The bought 3 polar fleece caps and they are all one size fits all, but either I have a big head or something becuase it doesn't cover my ears all the way. As for my husband that actually has a small head it fits him fine. So I guess if you have a big head don't get it becuase it will not cover your ears.
B000A3908K:order_not_wanted_:patricia_avent	1.0	I don't want this order.when I look into this it said it wasn,t available,so I looked into something else. If there is anything else that you have that I was to order please cancel everything because I haven't ordered anything else from you and anything that was ordered in February I don't want now..Thank you..
B0000YWCRA:what_size_is_it?:"lk-shinonome"	2.0	I don't own this gear bag, and I'm not going to buy it even though it looks interesting.  Would this be a suitable carry-on bag, or would I have to check it?  I don't know.  The dimensions are not given anywhere.  I want to know more about the products I order
B000ESDSVQ:missing_pieces,_cheap:clothes_horse_"chica77"	2.0	no lace collar as advertised. cheap, nylon-like fabric. not worth the price
B000BYR0VW:illuminite_does_not_work_as_advertised:r._alger	1.0	The non-functioning illuminating speckles on Illuminite products quickly disappear despite following care instructions. If you pay less for their clothing than regular clothing, go for it. If you're paying more, you're wasting your money
B0001EKI0W:product_looks_good,_smells_bad:m._morton	2.0	I was happy at the appearance of the bag, but was extremely disappointed in the smell of the backpack.  I received it around Christmas time and have had it hanging outside since hoping to air out the smell.  It still smells making it unable to use
B0002OQV7K:this_product_is_typical_in_that_it_has_a_tight_waist_band.:robert_g._reoch	1.0	I am in great shape.

B00063FVLO:the_late_gloves:dr._eugene_pattison	1.0	I am still waiting for these two pairs of gloves which were to have been USmailed and which were predicted to arrive yesterday, March 28
B000A5L60I:_too_small:alex_visurraga_"alex"	1.0	do  not buy this i got a large and feels like a smal
B0002X683S:poor_construction_with_cloth_that_is_too_thin_:michael_l._higgins_"pocket_pool"	1.0	This garment is poorly sewn with cloth which was too thin to provide some very necessary functions for men. If you just want underwear look on; however, if your aim is to obtain a bedroom brief you can do better for less. At is unless the view is everythin
B0000720HO:ok,_i_guess:lexi's_mom	2.0	I bought this dress in black.  Good news--- it does flatter your postpartum shape.  Bad news--- the pockets for the nursing pads don't go where they should, causing leakage.  Worse, the color black showed milk stains after I leaked.  Definitely not worth the price.  How important is your figure when you're sleeping anyway
B000BNMAJ0:this_is_not_a_follow-on_from_the_sawtooth:john_doe	2.0	A good trail shoe has a shank that will help navigate rocky/boulder type terrain. The previous model called the Sawtooth had the shank, and the Tigertooth does not. I recommend an all terrain tennis shoe before this shoe. 

By the way, I just loved the Sawtooth from Columbia. The business decision to drop the Sawtooth was a mistake. The shoe was great for Rocky desert hiking. I convinced 6 of my friends to buy it
B000BB6DPE:this_is_not_real:keith_e._mayo	1.0	I am tired of companies making money off of fakes.  The U.S. Government did not buy their field jackets from China.  These M65 O.D. Green Field Jackets are not real--They are a mid-grade reproductions
B0006HA17E:small:m._long_"shoe_lover"	2.0	The shoes would have been awesome but..... the sizes run extremely small.
I even ordered a size larger than normal thinking maybe this would happen.
The shoes are still too small.
B000FE9AW0:kind_of_a_letdown..._a_little:the_stellar_one_"aj"	2.0	I totally didn't have a problem with the seller or anything, great shipping! Um, but, the book kinda rots. If you know how to tie a tie already, then it might be fine, but I don't. The pictures didn't really help, and the wording wasn't concise. One sentence could be interpreted like nine ways!! I practically destroyed one tie, definitely practice with a tie you don't care about or one that doesnt need to be dry-cleaned, cuz they get pretty rumpled.
B0006MZWKU:buy_a_longer_length_than_usual.:meryl_fine	1.0	Good, flattering fit.  I'm 5'2" and I bought a short which was perfect and long enough to wear with heels, even a bit long actually.  Unfortunately when I washed them, they shrank 2" and now I have to wear them with flats.  I would buy them again, just in a longer length
B000HKHCW2:sizing_way_too_small:jennifer_a._miller	2.0	These are nice shoes, however the sizing is way small!  I would recommend ordering at least a size or two larger than what you normally wear
B000B5ULC6:didn't_receive_it_on_time.:a._huddleston	2.0	I ordered this to go under my Halloween costume nine days in advance, and it arrived too late for me to wear it.  It's still in the package in my closet.  Maybe next year..
B000FIV2FY:cheap_soles:gaglil	2.0	I bought these slippers for my husband at Christmas time.  I thought if I 
spent $50 on slippers they would last a long time, and be made very well.
I was wrong.  The slippers look good, and the upper leather is very nice
but the sole is a cheap, thin foam.  If you bend it, it snaps.  You would 
expect to find this on a cheap, $2 flip flop.  I was very disappointed.  I bought my husband a cheap $2 pair of suede slippers in Walmart that were just as nice with a thick rubber sole.
B0002M6G4U:these_are_horrible:pat_miller_"pat"	1.0	Even for $13 I expected some quality and got very little. The dye from the leather dyed my feet during a rain storm. The footpad was so rough it irritated the botton of my foot. The leather over the toe was so rough it irritated my toe. These were REALLY poor
B000EP2LA8:just_a_warning!:paul_stone	1.0	I almost fell for it...then I realized, how in the world are those pearls so cheap??  They aren't real!  If you are a sucker for a good deal like me think about it before you buy it.  It would be helpful if the item was advertised as "imitation pearl thong."
B000KEZ23Q:no:nilofar_zameni_"dd"	1.0	do not waste you money on this piece of sh** case not only it is loose it;s bad quality i just got it two days ago and the arm band came apart, and i have no idea what this white thing is that it comes with it is useless. what a waste of money.
B0000AA3WC:this_is_a_wicked_bad_idea.:s._petralia_"doctor_of_ideas"	2.0	If your name were Johnny Damon, maybe.  But you're bagging groceries at the Star Market for $7.25/hour.  Is this jersey really worth a day's pay to you?  The chicks aren't gonna be fooled into thinking you're on the team.  The Sox won't vote you a World Series share.  Your mom's gonna throw it in the dryer and shrink the beejesus out of it, and you're gonna wish you had that money back when your buddy Tommy is selling his old Malibu.
B000E84T96:misleading_description,_plus_sizing_not_true:david_kozuki	1.0	I see from another comment that this shoe was listed as having a real leather upper, which is why I bought it.  I see now that the description has been corrected, but too late for me.

also, the sizing does not run true as the current description states.  I usually wear 9.5, but I have bloody blisters from trying to play in these shoes
B000E84T96:make_sure_it's_leather:m._halford	2.0	I've bought the Predator Absolion TRXFG before and it is a great shoe. However, in this case it is clearly advertised as having a leather upper -- and the pair I received yesterday (blue with red and silver) is synthetic.  Make sure that if you order a leather shoe at the advertised price, you receive a leather shoe! You are not "saving $50" if it's synthetic
B000ARJT5K:find_a_better_boot:s._boone	2.0	You get what you pay for, I guess, but I really don't like these boots. They look fine, and the construction (appearance) seems sound; however they are NOT comfortable. I have had several pairs of Skechers sneakers and expected these boots to be comfortable (at least nearly so). Yet the right boot's footbed is clearly not manufactured correctly, as I can barely go an 8 hour workday wearing them. It feels as though there is a hump under my smaller toes. My foot also seems to pronate markedly. The left boot doesn't seem to suffer from the same defect. They also have very "hard" cushioning...I can't imagine them being worn in a work environment -requiring- boots.

Also I've had the boots less than a month and the laces are starting to fray where they contact the eyelets.

I should probably return them as defective, but the extra shipping fee makes that cost prohibitive
B000FE76AI:never_received:christine_m._andrews	1.0	Do not buy from this company - I ORDERED AND PAID FOR THIS AND NEVER RECEIVED IT!
B000FE76AI:don't_buy_from_this_company!_poor_poor_customer_service:christine_m._andrews	1.0	I ordered 2 wristlets - a brown and a leopard print. I was sent TWO brown wristlets, the return process was difficult, and when I returned the product I DID NOT RECEIVE A REFUND OR THE CORRECT PRODUCT!!
B00009YQX2:need_be_contortionist_to_wear:j._kern_"josie's_mama"	2.0	I bought this bra based on a majority of good reviews and blessings from Oprah Winfrey. I am a 38DD and could barley get the bra on. I have always been big busted and struggled to find good support. When I was younger I was trained in classical ballet. I have no problem with range of motion. I still had a hard time getting this bra on. Not to mention, I was falling out all over the place. I am very disappointed with the quality of this bra for the money. I would recommend "Jogbra" or "Chamion" for less money, better fit and better hold if you are big busted.
B00009YQX2:not_impressed.:mercy_donovan	2.0	I'm a 32DD, and while this bra does virtually eliminate bounce, I could get the same results with duct tape. Unflattering shape, uniboob (with the accompanying "interesting sweat" problems) and overpriced.
B000KQ1PDK:do_not_buy_these:brooke_rangel	1.0	I bought these for a bridal shower gift. They say one size fits all but they where like an XXXSmall. They torn right when they where tried on. VERY POOR QUALITY!!!! DO NOT BUY THESE
B0009WG5PS:disappointed:kathleen_vandewoestyne	1.0	I really wanted these boots and had been contemplating getting them for almost 6 months.  When they came I was so excited and took them out of the box to look at them and they were stained.  I was extremely disappointed that the product was defective, because I have never had a problem with any Amazon products in the past, I sent it back and I was reimbursed for my purchase.  I am really disappointed I will think twice before I purchase any shoes from Amazon again
B0007PIHQ2:don't_buy_this_if_you_want_control:candy_l._lawson_"candy_bright"	2.0	The title says it all.  This product does not offer much in the way of control and it is definitely not firm.  Basically you are spending $35 for a high waist brief
B000H23YO0:they_did_not_ship_the_jacket_in_the_picture....:christian_salcedo_"alan_britto"	1.0	The jacket itself its well made. BUT they sent a jacket with different colors and it does not look as nice as the one in the picture..
B000FELW4Y:leave_them_on_the_shelf,_weird_looking.:r._savitsky	1.0	I was so excited to find these, they seemed the perfect combination of elegance and comfort.  They look weird.  They went straight back, and after paying shipping and return shipping, I practically have to pay them to take it back:-
B0002YIHN6:not_made_for_size_d:gift_card_recipient	1.0	I just wanted to let all other bigger busted women know to NOT buy this product. It is made for smaller busted women in mind. There is no support and barely any coverage for bigger busted woman. It was a trial on my part but I hope by writing this it will help other women avoid making the same mistake. Stick with the strapless bras ladies!
B000E90HKA:don't_waste_your_money!:sonflower5b	1.0	We bought this for our teenage son.  The handling of the shipping was prompt, that is the only good thing I can say about the coat.  I will definately agree with a previous posting that the wool seems to be of very poor quality, almost felt-like. The item that looked not so great after taking it out of the box, looked terrible after only a week or so of my son wearing it to school!  I am almost ashamed to send him out of the house in the coat. If it was not so cold, I would tell him to go back to the sweatshirt he was wearing!  The item pills making it look really shabby.  No reports of seams ripped, buttons lost, or holes in the pocket, however, he may be worried that if he tells me about those things I will be upset with him because the coat was just a waste of money.  It was a major clothing item that he had picked out for himself, so imagine his disappointment!  I expected much more of the coat than I got,  and I am looking for a replacement
B000K9ZBFK:not_sturdy:ying_s._yu_"aysweetie"	2.0	This corset is not well made at all.  It's made of really cheap plastic boning and the boning sticked out after just a night of wear.  (I wore it to the club one night and by the end of the night the boning sticked through the top.
B000CPJH4S:not_what_it_advertises:g._bertagnolli_"sedryn"	1.0	Looks nothing like the image shown. 3 inches shy of even hitting the knee, let alone over it (and she isn't tall 5'5"). Keep looking....
B000BT582U:a_mistake_i_will_not_repeat:christine_l._berger	1.0	This was called learning the hard way not to believe the hype and not to buy shoes on line.  The fit was awful, there is no cushioning to speak of in the soles and other than looking good off my feet these shoes are useless
B000BT582U:major_disappointment:christine_l._berger	1.0	I ended up giving away these shoes after wearing them one day.  We have a recycle area in our apartment building, but it is usually used for things that are not brand new!  These shoes hurt my feet and had no cushioning at all against the concrete I walk on.  I will not buy another pair of shoes on line again, unless I know the make and size from hands on purchase before
B0001ZNXC6:not_sexy.:yasmine_latin	1.0	Men here is a tip.  If you want to please your lady, use a sexy thong instead.  We love how a man looks in a thong
B00065OX9I:worthless:m._burch	1.0	Bought these to keep the toes warm will riding my motocycle in the cold weather - worthless - no heat detected - you really feel the bulky wire if you don't put them on exactly right - heavy d-cell draws down the sock on your leg - don't bother, put the extra 25 bucks into your boots
B000086Q9R:owwy!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!:jennifer	1.0	These shoes are hideous! Who would wear them? They are so uncomfortable. They always give me blisters! I hate these shoes. Do not buy them unless you like getting blisters
B000AAQBO4:toss_away_bibs:liz	2.0	I prefer the bibsters.  The quality on the toss away bibs is not as good - the material is quite thin, the closure uses a sticker that never stays closed
B0001YR1YS:size_matters:kermit_robinson	2.0	I always buy the same size and type of overalls and this is the first time ordering this pair from Dickies.  They are very stiff and tight fitting.  They should have actually been baggy on me, being the size that they were
B000FSGF7E:sizing_is_terrible:e._waller	1.0	I got this for my newborn son and it's so big- it fits my husband.  I wish it said something in the ad about this ridiculously big infant hat!!
